====================================================================
WHY YOU NEED AUTO INSURANCE
====================================================================

There are three main reasons to buy auto insurance:

1. TO COMPLY WITH STATE LAWS
Most states, including Ohio, have auto insurance requirements. If you drive without insurance, you could be fined, and your vehicle could be impounded.

2. TO SATISFY YOUR LENDER
If you have a car loan, most lenders require you to have insurance to protect their interest in your car. If you let your insurance lapse, your lender will likely have your car insured. The premium may be much higher (and the coverage much less) than a policy you would buy on your own. The lender can require you to pay this higher premium until you get your own auto insurance.

3. TO PROTECT YOUR ASSETS
Auto insurance can provide bodily injury and property damage liability coverage for accidents that happen to others for which you are responsible. Liability insurance also will pay the cost of an attorney to protect you if you're sued.

The state-required minimum coverages are usually not enough to fully protect you and your assets. Auto insurance also may cover the cost of accident-related repairs to your insured car, as well as your accident-related medical bills and lost wages.

====================================================================
OHIO AUTO INSURANCE REQUIREMENTS
====================================================================

Ohio Minimum Coverage Requirements:
- $25,000 bodily injury liability per person
- $50,000 bodily injury liability per accident
- $25,000 property damage liability per accident

These minimums are often expressed as 25/50/25.

IMPORTANT: These state minimums are NOT enough to fully protect you if you cause a serious accident. We recommend higher liability limits to protect your assets.

Ohio-Specific Rules:
- Proof of insurance required in vehicle at all times
- Uninsured motorist coverage is available but not required by law
- Financial responsibility required after certain violations
- Insurance must be maintained continuously or you may face penalties

====================================================================
AUTO INSURANCE COVERAGES IN DETAIL
====================================================================

REQUIRED BY OHIO LAW:

BODILY INJURY LIABILITY
What it is: This coverage applies to injuries that you cause to someone else in an accident where you're at fault.

What it covers:
- Medical expenses for injured parties
- Lost wages for injured parties
- Pain and suffering damages
- Legal defense costs if you're sued
- Court-awarded judgments up to your policy limits

Who is covered: You and family members listed on the policy are also covered when driving someone else's car with their permission.

What it doesn't cover:
- Your own injuries (that's what Medical Payments or PIP covers)
- Injuries you cause intentionally
- Injuries while using vehicle for business purposes (need commercial policy)

Important notes:
- This is the most important coverage you can buy
- If damages exceed your policy limits, you're personally responsible for the rest
- Being underinsured can put your assets at risk

PROPERTY DAMAGE LIABILITY
What it is: This coverage pays for damages you cause to someone else's car or to objects and structures your car hits.

What it covers:
- Repairs to other vehicles you damage
- Damage to buildings, fences, mailboxes, utility poles
- Damage to other people's property inside their vehicle
- Legal defense if you're sued for property damage

What it doesn't cover:
- Damage to your own vehicle (that's collision coverage)
- Damage to your own property
- Intentional damage

OPTIONAL BUT COMMONLY REQUIRED BY LENDERS:

COLLISION COVERAGE
What it is: This coverage pays for damage to your car from a collision with another car, an object, or from flipping over.

What it covers:
- Damage from hitting another vehicle
- Damage from hitting objects (trees, poles, guardrails)
- Damage from hitting potholes
- Damage if your car rolls over
- Minus your deductible

How it works:
You choose a deductible (typically $250, $500, or $1,000). You pay the deductible; insurance pays the rest up to your car's actual cash value.

What it doesn't cover:
- Normal wear and tear
- Mechanical breakdowns
- Damage from non-collision events (theft, weather, vandalism)

When to consider dropping it:
If your car is worth less than $3,000-$4,000, the premium cost may not be worth it. Calculate: (Annual premium + deductible) vs. car's value.

COMPREHENSIVE COVERAGE
What it is: This coverage reimburses you for damage to your car that's not caused by a collision.

What it covers:
- Theft of your vehicle or parts
- Vandalism and malicious mischief
- Fire damage
- Hail damage
- Flood damage
- Windstorm damage
- Hitting animals (deer, dogs, etc.)
- Falling objects (tree branches, etc.)
- Glass damage (windshield chips and cracks)
- Civil disturbance/riot damage

How it works:
You choose a deductible. Some companies offer $0 deductible for windshield repairs specifically.

What it doesn't cover:
- Collision damage
- Normal wear and tear
- Mechanical breakdown
- Damage from poor maintenance
- Custom equipment (may need separate coverage)

Important notes:
- Required by lenders if you have a car loan
- Often called "other than collision" coverage
- Generally less expensive than collision coverage

MEDICAL PAYMENTS COVERAGE
What it is: This coverage pays for treating injuries to you and your passengers, regardless of who caused the accident.

What it covers:
- Medical expenses
- Hospital bills
- Surgical costs
- X-rays and diagnostic tests
- Ambulance fees
- Dental work needed from accident
- Funeral expenses

Who is covered:
- You and family members in any vehicle
- Passengers in your vehicle
- You and family members as pedestrians hit by a vehicle

What it doesn't cover:
- Lost wages (that's PIP)
- Injuries not related to auto accidents
- Injuries covered by health insurance (coordinate benefits)

PERSONAL INJURY PROTECTION (PIP)
What it is: Available in "no-fault" states, PIP provides broader coverage than Medical Payments.

What it covers:
- Medical and hospital expenses
- Lost wages from inability to work
- Replacement services (if you can't perform household tasks)
- Funeral expenses
- Survivor benefits

How no-fault works:
If you live in a no-fault state, your own insurance company pays for injuries to you and your passengers regardless of who's at fault. Most no-fault states also let you sue the at-fault driver if you have serious injuries. However, you still must file a claim with the at-fault driver's insurance company to be paid for damage to your vehicle.

Note: Ohio is NOT a no-fault state, but this coverage may be available as an option.

UNINSURED MOTORIST COVERAGE (UM)
What it is: This coverage reimburses you if an uninsured or hit-and-run driver hits you.

What it covers:
- Your medical expenses
- Lost wages
- Pain and suffering
- Damage to your vehicle (in some states)
- Injuries to passengers

When it applies:
- The at-fault driver has no insurance
- Hit-and-run accidents where driver can't be identified
- Driver's insurance company is insolvent

Important notes:
- Available but not required in Ohio
- Highly recommended since many drivers are uninsured
- Typically limited to your bodily injury liability limits

UNDERINSURED MOTORIST COVERAGE (UIM)
What it is: This coverage pays when an at-fault driver doesn't have enough insurance to fully pay for your loss.

What it covers:
The difference between the at-fault driver's coverage and your actual damages, up to your UIM limits.

Example:
- Your medical bills are $100,000
- At-fault driver only has $25,000 coverage
- Your UIM coverage pays the remaining $75,000 (if you have sufficient UIM limits)

When to buy it:
Recommended if you have significant assets to protect or could face large medical expenses.

====================================================================
ADDITIONAL OPTIONAL COVERAGES
====================================================================

RENTAL REIMBURSEMENT
What it covers: Pays for rental car while your vehicle is being repaired after a covered loss.

Typical limits: $30-$50 per day for up to 30 days

When it helps: If you don't have another vehicle available or can't afford rental costs out of pocket.

ROADSIDE ASSISTANCE/TOWING
What it covers:
- Towing to nearest repair shop
- Jump starts
- Flat tire changes
- Lockout service
- Fuel delivery
- Winching (pulling vehicle out of ditch)

Alternative: AAA membership provides similar services

GAP INSURANCE
What it is: Pays the difference between your car's actual cash value and what you still owe on your loan if the car is totaled.

When you need it:
- You owe more than the car is worth (upside down)
- Small or no down payment on car loan
- Long loan term (60+ months)
- Car depreciates quickly

Example:
- You owe $20,000 on loan
- Car is totaled, worth $15,000
- Gap insurance pays the $5,000 difference

Note: Often available through car dealer, but shop around for better rates.

CUSTOM EQUIPMENT COVERAGE
What it covers:
- Aftermarket stereo systems
- Custom wheels and tires
- Body kits and spoilers
- Performance modifications
- Custom paint

Note: Standard policies typically don't cover aftermarket equipment or only cover minimal amounts.

RIDESHARE COVERAGE
Who needs it: Drivers for Uber, Lyft, or other transportation network companies

What it covers: The gap between personal auto insurance and the rideshare company's commercial coverage

When it applies:
- App is on but you haven't accepted a ride
- During pickups and dropoffs
- Between rides

CRITICAL: Personal auto policies exclude coverage while using vehicle for hire. You MUST have rideshare coverage or you'll have no protection.

====================================================================
DOES INSURANCE FOLLOW ME OR THE CAR?
====================================================================

GENERAL RULE: Insurance follows the car, not the driver.

YOUR CAR, SOMEONE ELSE DRIVING:
If you give someone permission to drive your car, your insurance is primary (covers first). Their insurance may provide secondary coverage if damages exceed your limits.

SOMEONE ELSE'S CAR, YOU DRIVING:
If you drive someone else's car with permission, their insurance covers the accident. Your insurance might provide secondary coverage.

RENTAL CARS:
Your personal auto insurance typically extends to rental cars for personal use. Credit cards may also provide coverage. Check both before buying rental company insurance.

BORROWED CARS:
If you regularly borrow someone's car (spouse, household member, frequent use), you should be listed on their policy.

EXCEPTIONS:
- Business use of vehicle
- Vehicles you don't have permission to drive
- Intentional acts
- Excluded drivers on the policy

IMPORTANT: Always verify coverage before driving any vehicle that's not yours.

====================================================================
HOW MUCH COVERAGE SHOULD YOU HAVE?
====================================================================

OHIO MINIMUM IS NOT ENOUGH
The state minimum (25/50/25) will NOT adequately protect you in a serious accident.

RECOMMENDED LIABILITY LIMITS:
Conservative: 100/300/100 ($100k per person, $300k per accident, $100k property)
Better Protection: 250/500/100
Strong Protection: 500/500/100 or higher

FACTORS TO CONSIDER:
1. Your net worth and assets (home, savings, investments)
2. Your income (can be garnished in judgments)
3. Your risk tolerance
4. Number of drivers in household
5. How much you drive

RULE OF THUMB: Carry liability limits equal to or greater than your net worth.

DEDUCTIBLE SELECTION:
Higher deductible = Lower premium

Common deductibles:
- Auto: $250, $500, $1,000
- Home: $1,000, $2,500, $5,000

Choose deductible based on:
- What you can afford to pay out of pocket
- Your savings cushion
- Your claims history (file less often = consider higher deductible)

BALANCE: Premium savings vs. out-of-pocket risk

====================================================================
WHAT AFFECTS YOUR AUTO INSURANCE PREMIUM
====================================================================

DRIVING RECORD
Insurance companies typically look at the last 3-5 years of driving history for all drivers on the policy.

What increases rates:
- At-fault accidents
- Speeding tickets
- DUI/DWI convictions
- Reckless driving
- License suspensions
- Multiple violations

CREDIT-BASED INSURANCE SCORE
Most insurers use information from your credit report to calculate a credit-based insurance score. Studies show correlation between this score and likelihood of filing claims.

Note: This is different from your credit score used for loans. Some states restrict or ban use of credit in insurance pricing.

If you've had a hardship affecting your credit, ask your insurer about life event exceptions.

AGE, GENDER, AND MARITAL STATUS
- Drivers under 25: Higher rates (especially males)
- Teen drivers: Highest rates
- Drivers over 65: Rates may increase
- Married drivers: Typically lower rates than single
- Families with young drivers: Higher household rates

Note: Some states prohibit using gender in pricing.

VEHICLE TYPE
Higher premiums for:
- Newer or more expensive vehicles
- Sports cars and high-performance vehicles
- Vehicles with higher theft rates
- Vehicles that cost more to repair
- Large SUVs/trucks (for liability due to damage they can cause)

Lower premiums for:
- Vehicles with good safety ratings
- Vehicles with anti-theft devices
- Vehicles that are inexpensive to repair

LOCATION
Where you live and park your vehicle affects rates:

Urban areas: Higher rates due to:
- More traffic = more accidents
- Higher theft rates
- More claims in the area

Rural areas: Generally lower rates

Your specific ZIP code matters based on local claim patterns.

ANNUAL MILEAGE AND VEHICLE USE
More miles driven = higher rates

Typical tiers:
- Low: Under 7,500 miles/year
- Average: 7,500-15,000 miles/year
- High: Over 15,000 miles/year

Commuting distance also affects rates.

PRIOR INSURANCE COVERAGE
You may pay more if:
- You've had a lapse in coverage
- You only carried state minimum coverage previously
- You're a new driver with no insurance history

Continuous coverage = better rates

PREVIOUS CLAIMS
Insurance companies report claims to databases like CLUE (Comprehensive Loss Underwriting Exchange). Insurers check these when you apply.

Claims affect rates even if:
- You weren't at fault (in some states)
- The claim was small
- It happened years ago (within reporting period)

You have a right to request your free CLUE report.

COVERAGE LIMITS AND DEDUCTIBLES
Higher limits = higher premiums
Higher deductibles = lower premiums

This is the easiest way to control your premium.

DISCOUNTS AVAILABLE
Ask about discounts for:
- Multi-policy (home + auto with same company)
- Multi-vehicle
- Good student (for teen drivers)
- Defensive driving course
- Low mileage
- Vehicle safety features (airbags, anti-lock brakes)
- Anti-theft devices
- Paid-in-full
- Paperless billing
- Homeowner (even if home insured elsewhere)
- Professional affiliations
- Military service

====================================================================

- It's a minor single-vehicle accident
- You can afford to pay repair costs
- You want to protect your claims history

IMPORTANT: Even if you decide not to file, report the accident to your insurance company. They need to know about it in case the other party files later.

Step 3: WE EVALUATE THE LOSS
We'll help you determine:
- Is this covered under your policy?
- Is the damage greater than your deductible?
- Should you file a claim or pay out of pocket?
- What documentation you need

If loss is less than your deductible: We'll advise not filing a claim and you handle repairs yourself.

If loss exceeds your deductible: We'll help you proceed with the claim.

Step 4: WE HELP YOU FILE THE CLAIM
- We contact your insurance company on your behalf

WHAT TO EXPECT FROM THE INSURANCE COMPANY

CLAIMS ADJUSTER ASSIGNMENT
The insurance company will assign a claims adjuster to:
- Investigate the claim
- Assess the damages
- Determine coverage
- Calculate payment amount

The adjuster may be:
- An employee of the insurance company
- An independent contractor
- A third-party administrator

DOCUMENTATION REQUIRED
Be prepared to provide:
- Police report (if applicable)
- Photos of damage
- Repair estimates
- Medical bills and records (for injury claims)
- Proof of ownership
- Receipts for damaged property
- Witness statements
- Any other requested information

Cooperate fully with the investigation. Failure to cooperate can result in claim denial.

VEHICLE DAMAGE ASSESSMENT
For vehicle damage claims:

1. INSPECTION
Adjuster will inspect damage to determine:
- Extent of damage
- Whether vehicle is repairable or total loss
- Estimated repair costs

2. REPAIR ESTIMATE
Adjuster will provide estimate for repairs. You may:
- Get your own estimates to compare
- Choose your own repair shop (usually)
- Request reinspection if you disagree

3. TOTAL LOSS DETERMINATION
Vehicle is considered totaled when:
- Repair costs exceed vehicle's actual cash value
- Repair costs exceed a percentage of value (varies by state)
- Vehicle is unsafe to repair

If totaled:
- Insurance pays actual cash value minus deductible
- You may keep vehicle (salvage) if you choose
- Lienholder is paid first if you have loan
- GAP insurance covers difference between value and loan amount

ACTUAL CASH VALUE vs. REPLACEMENT COST
Insurance typically pays Actual Cash Value (ACV):
- Fair market value of vehicle before accident
- NOT what you paid for it
- NOT what it costs to buy same vehicle today
- Takes depreciation into account

This often surprises people. Vehicles depreciate quickly.

PAYMENT TIMELINE
Varies by:
- Complexity of claim
- Availability of documentation
- Need for investigations
- State regulations

Typical timeline:
- Simple claims: 3-10 days
- Complex claims: 2-4 weeks
- Total loss: 2-3 weeks
- Injury claims: Weeks to months

CLAIMS THAT MAY BE DENIED

Common denial reasons:
- Incident not covered by policy
- Policy lapsed or cancelled at time of loss
- Excluded driver was operating vehicle
- Intentional damage
- Fraud or misrepresentation
- Failure to cooperate with investigation
- Damage from wear and tear or poor maintenance

If your claim is denied:
- Ask for written explanation
- Review your policy
- Contact SamurAi Code for assistance
- Consider state insurance department complaint if appropriate
- You may need legal advice for disputes

====================================================================
WHEN SHOULD YOU FILE A CLAIM?
====================================================================

FACTORS TO CONSIDER

1. CLAIM SIZE vs. DEDUCTIBLE
If damage is $600 and deductible is $500, you only get $100 from insurance. Often not worth filing.

General rule: Don't file unless damage exceeds deductible by at least $500-$1,000.

2. POTENTIAL RATE INCREASE
Filing a claim may increase your premium at renewal. Calculate:
- Expected rate increase over 3-5 years
- vs. Cost to pay for damage yourself

Sometimes paying yourself saves money long-term.

3. YOUR CLAIMS HISTORY
Multiple claims can:
- Increase your rates significantly
- Lead to policy non-renewal
- Make you harder to insure elsewhere

Consider your recent claims history before filing.

4. TYPE OF CLAIM
Different claim types affect rates differently:
- At-fault accidents: Biggest impact
- Comprehensive claims: Moderate impact
- Not-at-fault accidents: Minimal to no impact (varies by state)

Note: In Ohio and some other states, insurers CAN increase rates even for not-at-fault accidents.

5. YOUR FAULT vs. OTHER PARTY'S FAULT
If accident was clearly other driver's fault:
- File through their insurance (third-party claim)
- No impact on your insurance
- But requires proving their fault

If you're at fault or fault is unclear:
- File through your own insurance
- May affect your rates
- Your insurance company handles everything

WHEN IN DOUBT: Ask SamurAi Code before filing. We'll help you make the best decision for your specific situation.

====================================================================
IF YOU DISAGREE WITH THE INSURANCE COMPANY
====================================================================

STEPS TO RESOLVE DISPUTES

1. UNDERSTAND THE DECISION
Ask the adjuster to:
- Explain the decision in writing
- Provide documentation supporting their decision
- Point to specific policy provisions
- Show their calculations

2. REVIEW YOUR POLICY
Read the relevant sections carefully. Understand:
- What's covered and what's excluded
- Policy definitions
- Your rights under the policy

3. CONTACT SAMURAI CODE
We can:
- Review the claim with you
- Help you understand the decision
- Advocate on your behalf with the insurance company
- Explain your options

4. GET ADDITIONAL ESTIMATES
For repair disputes:
- Get independent estimates
- Have your repair shop meet with adjuster
- Request re-inspection if needed

5. REQUEST APPRAISAL
Many policies include an appraisal clause for disputes about value or damage amount:
- You hire an appraiser
- Insurance company hires an appraiser
- If they disagree, they select an umpire
- Appraisal decision is binding

6. FILE COMPLAINT WITH STATE
You can file a complaint with Ohio Department of Insurance if:
- Insurance company violates regulations
- Claim handling is unfair or unreasonable
- You're not getting timely responses

7. CONSIDER PUBLIC ADJUSTER
Public adjusters are licensed professionals who:
- Work for you, not the insurance company
- Help document and present your claim
- Negotiate with insurance company
- Charge percentage of settlement (typically 10-15%)

Note: Only use if claim is large and complex. Check license status with state.

8. LEGAL ACTION
As a last resort:
- Consult with attorney
- Consider arbitration or mediation
- File lawsuit if necessary

Most insurance disputes resolve before reaching court.

====================================================================
POLICY CANCELLATION AND NON-RENEWAL
====================================================================

UNDERSTANDING THE DIFFERENCE

CANCELLATION:
Insurance company or you end coverage before policy's normal expiration date.

NON-RENEWAL:
Insurance company chooses not to renew when your policy term ends (usually 6 or 12 months).

WHY POLICIES GET CANCELLED

Common reasons insurers cancel:
- Non-payment of premium
- Fraud or material misrepresentation
- License suspension or revocation
- Too many claims
- DUI conviction
- Significant increase in risk

TIMELINE AND NOTICE:
- States regulate cancellation rules
- Typically require 10-30 days notice
- Some reasons allow immediate cancellation

IF YOU CANCEL:
You usually get:
- Pro-rated refund for unused premium
- Minus any minimum earned premium
- Minus any cancellation fee

You should cancel when:
- Switching to another insurance company (but wait until new policy is active!)
- Selling vehicle
- No longer driving

NEVER let policy lapse before new one starts. Even one day without coverage can:
- Result in fines
- Make future insurance more expensive
- Leave you completely unprotected

WHY POLICIES DON'T RENEW

Reasons for non-renewal:
- Too many claims or violations
- Company leaving the market
- Company no longer offering your type of coverage
- Significant risk increase
- Credit issues

NOTICE REQUIREMENTS:
- Usually 30-60 days before expiration
- Must provide written notice
- Must state reason (in most states)

WHAT TO DO IF NON-RENEWED:
- Contact SamurAi Code immediately
- We'll shop other carriers for you
- Don't wait until last minute
- Expect higher rates if non-renewed for claims/violations

====================================================================
IF YOU CAN'T FIND INSURANCE
====================================================================

If you've been cancelled or can't find standard insurance:

OPTIONS:

1. WORK WITH SAMURAI CODE
We have access to multiple carriers with different underwriting. Someone who's high-risk for one company might be acceptable to another.

2. HIGH-RISK/NON-STANDARD INSURERS
Specialty companies insure high-risk drivers:
- Higher premiums
- May have limited coverages
- Better than no insurance

3. STATE ASSIGNED RISK PROGRAMS
Last resort option:
- State assigns you to an insurance company
- Very expensive
- Minimum coverage only
- Temporary solution while you improve record

4. IMPROVE YOUR RISK PROFILE
- Take defensive driving course
- Pay fines and reinstate license
- Build better credit
- Go claim-free for period of time
- Consider moving violations may drop off after 3 years

COMMON AUTO INSURANCE MYTHS
====================================================================

MYTH: The color of your car affects your insurance rates
TRUTH: Car color has no impact. Make, model, age, safety features, and theft rates matter.

MYTH: Your insurance automatically covers anyone driving your car
TRUTH: Generally yes with permission, but excluded drivers are not covered. Regular users should be listed on policy.

MYTH: Comprehensive coverage means you're fully covered for everything
TRUTH: Comprehensive only covers non-collision damage. You still need collision and liability coverage.

MYTH: Minimum insurance is enough
TRUTH: State minimums rarely provide adequate protection in serious accidents. You're personally liable for anything beyond your limits.

MYTH: If you're not at fault, your rates won't increase
TRUTH: Some states and companies can increase rates even for not-at-fault accidents.

MYTH: Your insurance covers everything in your car
TRUTH: Personal belongings may not be covered, or only for limited amounts. Check your homeowners/renters insurance.

MYTH: Insurance covers normal wear and tear
TRUTH: Only sudden, accidental damage is covered. Maintenance and mechanical issues are your responsibility.

MYTH: Older cars don't need collision/comprehensive
TRUTH: Depends on car's value and your financial situation. If you can't afford to replace it, you might need coverage.

MYTH: Staying with the same company gets you the best rates
TRUTH: Switchers save an average of $400/year. Loyalty doesn't always pay in insurance.

MYTH: Tickets don't matter if you pay them
TRUTH: Tickets and violations typically stay on your record for 3-5 years and increase your rates.

MYTH: Your credit score doesn't affect insurance
TRUTH: Most states allow credit-based insurance scoring, which significantly impacts rates.

MYTH: You don't need to report accidents if no one files a claim
TRUTH: You should always report accidents to your insurer, even if you don't file a claim. The other party might file later.

SPECIAL SITUATIONS
====================================================================

TEEN DRIVERS

Adding a teen driver significantly increases premiums. To minimize cost:
- Add teen to vehicle with lowest premium
- Maintain good student discount (usually 3.0 GPA or B average)
- Consider defensive driving course
- Increase deductibles if you can afford it
- Maintain higher liability limits (teens have more accidents)

Teens away at college:
- May qualify for distant student discount if school is 100+ miles away
- Must not have regular access to vehicle

SENIOR DRIVERS

Rates may increase after age 65-70 due to:
- Increased accident rates for elderly drivers
- Slower reaction times
- Vision and health issues

To keep rates down:
- Senior driver improvement courses
- Lower mileage (retired = less driving)
- Maintain good driving record
- Consider dropping collision/comprehensive on older vehicles

MILITARY MEMBERS

Special considerations:
- Vehicle storage discounts when deployed
- Some companies specialize in military insurance
- May be able to suspend coverage during deployment
- Special protections under Servicemembers Civil Relief Act

RIDE-SHARING (UBER/LYFT)

Critical: You MUST have rideshare coverage or commercial policy

Personal auto insurance:
- Does NOT cover when using vehicle for hire
- Will deny claims if you're driving for rideshare
- Can cancel your policy if they discover rideshare activity

Rideshare companies provide:
- Coverage when passenger is in vehicle
- Limited coverage when app is on but no passenger

The gap:
- When app is on but no passenger accepted
- This is when you need rideshare endorsement

BUSINESS USE

Personal auto policies exclude business use:
- Delivery (food, packages, etc.)
- Transporting clients or equipment
- Regular commuting to job sites with tools/materials
- Using vehicle in your business operations

You need commercial auto insurance for business use.

CLASSIC/COLLECTOR VEHICLES

Standard policies don't work well for classics:
- Agreed value coverage (not actual cash value)
- Mileage restrictions
- Storage requirements
- Lower premiums
- Specialized classic car insurers

MODIFICATIONS

Aftermarket modifications may:
- Not be covered under standard policy
- Increase your rates
- Require custom equipment coverage

Always notify insurer of:
- Performance modifications
- Custom wheels
- Audio/video systems
- Body modifications
