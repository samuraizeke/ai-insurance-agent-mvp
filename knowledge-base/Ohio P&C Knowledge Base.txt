ABOUT THE NAIC

The National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) is the oldest association of state government officials.

Its members consist of the chief insurance regulators in all 50 states, the District of Columbia and five U.S. territories.

The primary responsibility of the state regulators is to protect the interests of insurance consumers, and the NAIC

helps regulators fulfill that obligation in a number of different ways. This guide is one example of work done by the

NAIC to assist states in educating and protecting consumers.

Another way the NAIC lends support to state regulators is by providing a forum for the development of uniform public

policy when uniformity is appropriate. It does this through a series of model laws, regulations and guidelines,

developed for the states’ use. States that choose to do so may adopt the models intact or modify them to meet the

needs of their marketplace and consumers.

The NAIC’s mission is to assist state insurance regulators, individually and collectively, in serving the public interest

and achieving the following fundamental insurance regulatory goals in a responsive, efficient and cost effective

manner, consistent with the wishes of its members:

- Protect the public interest;
- Promote competitive markets;
- Facilitate the fair and equitable treatment of insurance consumers;
- Promote the reliability, solvency and financial solidity of insurance institutions; and
- Support and improve state regulation of insurance.

2022 NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF INSURANCE COMMISSIONERSA CONSUMER’S GUIDE TO AUTO INSURANCE: WHY YOU NEED AUTO INSURANCE

WHY YOU NEED AUTO INSURANCE

Auto insurance is an important purchase for most drivers. There are three main reasons to buy auto insurance.

1. To comply with state laws

Most states have auto insurance requirements. If you drive without insurance, you could be fined, and your vehicle

could be impounded.

2. To satisfy your lender

If you have a car loan, most lenders require you to have insurance to protect their interest in your car. If you let your

insurance lapse, your lender will likely have your car insured. The premium may be much higher (and the coverage

much less) than a policy you would buy on your own. The lender can require you to pay this higher premium until you

get your own auto insurance.

3. To protect your assets

Auto insurance can provide bodily injury and property damage liability coverage for accidents that happen to others

for which you are responsible. Liability insurance also will pay the cost of an attorney to protect you if you’re sued.

The state-required minimum coverages are usually not enough to fully protect you and your assets. Auto insurance

also may cover the cost of accident-related repairs to your insured car, as well as your accident-related medical bills

and lost wages.

COVERAGES IN AN AUTO POLICY

An auto insurance policy usually has several types of protections or “coverages” — some required and some

optional. Some coverages may automatically be part of your policy unless you opt out of them. You must decide what

coverages best fit your needs, which may mean choosing more coverages than you need to meet requirements.

Your auto policy may include the following coverages. Each coverage is usually priced separately.

Required by State Law

- Bodily Injury Liability: This coverage applies to injuries that you cause to someone else. You and family

members listed on the policy also are covered when driving someone else’s car with their permission.

- Property Damage Liability: This coverage pays for damages you cause to someone else’s car or to objects

and structures your car hits.

Required by Law in Some States

- ****Uninsured and Underinsured Motorist Coverage: Uninsured motorist coverage reimburses you if an uninsured or

a hit-and-run driver hits you. Underinsured motorist coverage pays when an at-fault driver doesn’t have enough

insurance to fully pay for your loss.

- ****Medical Payments or Personal Injury Protection (PIP): This coverage pays for treating injuries to you and your

2022 NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF INSURANCE COMMISSIONERS 1A CONSUMER’S GUIDE TO AUTO INSURANCE: COVERAGES IN AN AUTO POLICY

passengers. Personal Injury Protection (PIP), which is available in “no-fault” states, can also cover lost wages and funeral

costs.

No-fault. If you live in a no-fault state, your own insurance company pays for injuries to you and your

passengers regardless of who’s at fault. Most no-fault states also let you sue the at-fault driver if you have

serious injuries. However, you still must file a claim with the at-fault driver’s insurance company to be paid for

damage to your vehicle.

Required by Your Lender if You Have an Auto Loan

- Collision: This coverage pays for damage to your car from a collision with another car, an object or a pothole

or from flipping over.

- Comprehensive: This coverage reimburses you for damage to your car that’s not caused by a collision. This

includes theft, hail, windstorm, flood, fire and hitting animals. Comprehensive coverage also will reimburse

you if your windshield is pitted, cracked or damaged. Some companies won’t charge you a deductible for

windshield repairs.

Most insurers offer many other types of coverage, such as for towing and rental car when your car is disabled. Each

type of coverage likely will increase your premium so consider carefully what you need.

Most auto policies don’t cover equipment — including stereos, CD players, navigation systems and cell phones — not

permanently installed in your car, or maintenance for your car.

Auto insurance doesn’t cover paying off your loan if your car is damaged and its market value is less than what you owe.

Auto dealers and lenders may offer guaranteed auto protection (GAP) insurance for this purpose.

Your auto insurance will cover you if you drive into Canada. To drive into Mexico, however, you’ll need to buy

Mexican auto insurance. Ask your insurer about other requirements.

You’ll likely need a separate insurance policy for these types of vehicles:

- Motorcycles
- All-Terrain Vehicles (ATVs)
- Off-Road Vehicles
- RVs
- Commercial Vehicles

HOW INSURERS DETERMINE YOUR PREMIUM

Many factors affect the premium you pay, including which insurance company you choose. Different insurance

companies use different methods to rate their risk of insuring you and charge different premiums for similar

coverage.

These items will likely affect your premium:

2022 NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF INSURANCE COMMISSIONERS 2A CONSUMER’S GUIDE TO AUTO INSURANCE: DETERMINING YOUR PREMIUM

- Your driving record, and the driving records of others covered by your insurance policy, during the last three

to five years.

- Your credit-based insurance score. Those with better scores often pay lower premiums. Some states restrict

the ways insurers can use credit-based insurance scores and several states ban their use. If you’ve had a

hardship which may have hurt your credit history, ask your insurer if it will consider a life event exception.

Credit-based insurance scoring. Most insurers use the information in your credit report to calculate

a credit-based insurance score. They do this because studies show a correlation between this score

and the likelihood of filing a claim. Credit-based insurance scores are different from other credit

scores.

- Your age, gender and marital status. People under 25, males, single people and families with young drivers

in the household tend to have more accidents and therefore pay higher premiums. Accident rates (and

premiums) also tend to increase for people over age 65. Insurance companies can base premiums on all

insured drivers in your household, including those not related by blood, such as roommates.

- The type of vehicle you drive. Generally, you’ll pay more for insurance, particularly for comprehensive and

collision coverages, if your vehicle is newer or more expensive. Sports cars and high-performance vehicles

also cost more to insure because they’re involved in more accidents and thefts and cost more to repair. If

you drive a large SUV or truck, which can cause more serious damage in an accident, you could pay more for

liability coverage.

- Where you live. Urban areas usually have more accidents and auto thefts than rural areas.
- Vehicle use, including your annual mileage.
- Your prior insurance coverage. Most insurance companies will charge you more if you don’t have auto

insurance when you apply for coverage. Some also charge you more if you currently have only the state-

required minimum amounts of coverage.

2022 NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF INSURANCE COMMISSIONERS 3A CONSUMER’S GUIDE TO AUTO INSURANCE: DETERMINING YOUR PREMIUM

- Previous claims. Most insurance companies report your auto claims to one or more private nationwide

claim databases (such as the Comprehensive Loss Underwriting Exchange—CLUE). Insurance companies use

these databases to see the claims you’ve submitted in the past. You have a right to a free copy of your CLUE

report.

- The limits you choose for liability coverage.
- The deductibles you choose for comprehensive and collision coverages.

A deductible is the amount you have to pay out-of-pocket on a claim before the policy pays the loss.

Higher policy deductibles mean lower policy premiums. A policy with a $1,000 deductible has a

lower premium than the same policy with a $500 deductible. Having a higher deductible is a good way

to save money on your auto insurance premium and to submit fewer claims. But be sure you can

afford the deductible in case you have a loss.

Discounts

Most insurance companies offer various types of discounts. Ask the agent if there’s a discount for:

- Insuring your auto and your home with the same insurance company.
- Insuring multiple vehicles with the same insurance company.
- Protection devices such as airbags, anti-lock brakes and anti-theft devices.
- Taking a defensive driving course, particularly if you’re 55 or older.
- Being a member of an organization or working for certain employers.

2022 NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF INSURANCE COMMISSIONERS 4A CONSUMER’S GUIDE TO AUTO INSURANCE: SMART SHOPPING

SMART SHOPPING

Different insurance companies charge different rates for the same coverage. Also, not all insurance companies

provide the same level of claims service. So, it makes sense to shop around for the best insurance company for your

needs.

Insurance companies use one of three methods to sell their products.

- Independent agents represent several companies and can give you several quotes.
- Exclusive agents only sell the products of one insurance company.
- Direct market sales are done over the Internet or by mail or telephone.

The insurer—not you—usually pays the agent. The insurer may pay the agent a percentage of your premium as a

commission. An agent who is salaried may receive bonuses for sales.

You can find insurance companies and agents by asking friends and neighbors, browsing the Internet, looking

through the phone book, or in ads in the newspaper, on the radio and on television. You should also ask your state

insurance department if it publishes premium comparison guides for auto insurance.

Customer service is important to most consumers, particularly when they have a claim. A complaint index gives you a

sense of how well an insurer serves its customers. Many state insurance departments post complaint indexes on their

websites. A complaint index measures how many complaints your state insurance department receives relative to

the size of the company.

It’s illegal for unlicensed insurance companies or agents to sell insurance. Business cards and websites aren't proof

that an agent is licensed. If you buy insurance from an unlicensed agent or company it may not pay your claims or, if

you cancel your policy, it may not refund your premiums. To find out if an agent or company is licensed, check with

your state insurance department.

You also want to buy insurance from a company that’s financially sound. You can check the financial health of an

insurance company by using ratings from independent ratings agencies, such as Standard and Poor’s, A.M. Best and

Moody’s.

2022 NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF INSURANCE COMMISSIONERS 5A CONSUMER’S GUIDE TO AUTO INSURANCE: YOUR RESPONSIBILITIES

GETTING PREMIUM QUOTES

The way to compare different companies’ prices is to get premium quotes. But first you should decide what coverages

and policy limits you need. An agent can help you with this.

State law sets the minimum amounts of liability coverage required. These minimums are too low to fully cover you if

you cause a serious accident. Most insurers let you buy higher amounts or “limits” of liability coverage, often without

much increase in your premium.

When you get quotes be sure to ask for the same coverages and limits and give the same information to each agent or

company. Auto insurers may use all of the factors listed in the “How Insurers Determine Your Premium” section (and

maybe more) to price your policy. The insurer needs quite a bit of information to price your policy, usually including

your Social Security number and your vehicle’s VIN (vehicle identification number).

The premium for your insurance may be different from the quote you initially receive for several reasons. For

example, if you told the company or its agent that you have a perfect driving record and you don’t, your premium

will be higher than your quote. Be sure to get rate quotes and coverage information in writing.

Make sure you ask about discounts. Also be sure to find out how much your premium will change if you choose

different deductibles.

While you’re getting quotes, you should also ask the agent some of these questions:

- Are the agent and the insurance company licensed by my state insurance department? (Your state

insurance department can confirm this.)

- What limits are available?
- What coverage does state law require me to buy? What coverage will a lender require if I have a car

loan?

- Should I buy comprehensive and/or collision coverage? (Compare the premium to what your car is

worth.) If so, what deductibles can I choose?

- What doesn’t my policy cover?
- What is the deductible for uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage?
- How will my credit history affect my premium?
- How will my driving record affect my premium?
- If I’m in an accident and it wasn’t my fault, how will this affect my insurance? (In some states, insurers

can’t charge you a higher premium because of accidents that weren’t your fault.)

- If I’m in an accident and it was my fault, how will this affect my insurance?
- If I have an accident, can I use my own repair shop?
- If I let someone who doesn’t live in my home drive my car, am I covered? Am I covered if I drive

2022 NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF INSURANCE COMMISSIONERS 6A CONSUMER’S GUIDE TO AUTO INSURANCE: YOUR RESPONSIBILITIES

- someone else’s car?
- If my child is away at school, is s/he covered?
- If I rent a car, will my policy cover me?

YOUR RESPONSIBILITIES

An automobile insurance policy is a legal contract. It explains your rights and responsibilities and those of the

insurance company. Keep your policy in your home files and know the name of your insurer.

You should read your policy and be sure you understand it. If you have questions about your insurance policy, contact

your insurance agent or company.

When you buy auto insurance, you’ll receive a policy, not a photocopy. If you don't receive a policy within 30 days,

contact the insurance company. If you need a company's toll-free number, check their website, call your agent or

contact your state insurance department.

Other helpful tips:

- Pay the premium on time. Some insurers don’t accept late payments. If an insurer accepts your payment late,

it may increase your premium at renewal.

- Your full premium is due when your policy starts, which is usually every six months. Many insurance

companies will let you pay monthly. To do this, you’ll likely pay an extra fee.

- Keep your proof-of-insurance card in your car at all times; most states require this.
- Keep a file of all paperwork you completed online or received in the mail and signed, including the policy,

changes to your policy, renewal notices, correspondence, copies of advertisements, premium payment

receipts, notes of conversations and any claims submitted.

- Maintain your auto. You’re responsible for its upkeep and repair (including maintenance) to keep it in

good condition.

2022 NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF INSURANCE COMMISSIONERS 7A CONSUMER’S GUIDE TO AUTO INSURANCE: IF YOU’RE IN AN ACCIDENT

IF YOU’RE INVOLVED IN AN ACCIDENT

If you’re involved in an accident you should exchange information with the other driver. Get their name and address

and their insurance company’s name and phone number. This information is on the proof-of-insurance card in

their auto. If you can’t get this information, write down their driver’s license number and license plate number

to give to your insurance company. Be prepared to share the same information about yourself with the other driver.

- Call 911 if someone’s injured.
- If your car is drivable, move it out of traffic.
- Get this important information at the accident scene:
- The other car’s make, model, year and license plate number.
- Witnesses’ names and contact information.
- The name, badge number, and contact information for the officer who comes to the accident. Ask the

officer when and where to get the accident report and accident report number.

- The time, date and exact location of the accident, with notes of skid marks, weather and road conditions.

Take a photo or sketch a diagram of the accident scene.

- If your car is damaged by a hit-and-run driver or is stolen, promptly call the police.

2022 NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF INSURANCE COMMISSIONERS 8A CONSUMER’S GUIDE TO AUTO INSURANCE: FILING A CLAIM

FILING A CLAIM

Read your policy! It’s your guide to the types of losses that will and will not be covered and to filing claims. How often

you file a claim and the types of claims you file often affect your premium and whether your insurer will renew your

policy. If the cost to repair the damage is not much more than your deductible, you may want to pay for the repairs

without filing a claim.

To file a claim, call the phone number on your proof-of-insurance card as soon as possible. Ask about forms or

documents you’ll need to support your claim. Each state has its own laws about the claims process, and both you

and your insurer will need to follow those rules.

The insurance company will assign a claims adjuster to assess the damages and determine the payment. These

adjusters may be employees of the company or independent contractors. You should cooperate with the adjuster’s

investigation of your claim. The adjuster will probably want to meet with you to inspect the damage. Jot down notes

and keep track of the dates of any conversations you have with your agent or adjuster.

If you, the insurer and the claims adjuster disagree, first try to resolve the differences with your insurer. Your agent

may be helpful. It also might help to have your auto repairer meet with you and the insurance adjuster.

Don’t feel rushed or pushed to agree with something you aren’t comfortable with; your insurer doesn’t have the last

word. Ask questions and ask the adjuster to provide a written explanation of his decisions.

If you and the insurer still disagree about the claim handling or settlement, you should ask for help from the consumer

services personnel at your state insurance department. If you disagree about the value of the claim, check your policy

for an appraisal clause.

Another option is to hire an attorney or a public adjuster. A public adjuster isn’t an attorney or a government

employee. Those states that allow public adjusters require them to be licensed and to follow certain guidelines. If you

have questions about public adjusters in your state, contact your state insurance department.

2022 NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF INSURANCE COMMISSIONERS 9A CONSUMER’S GUIDE TO AUTO INSURANCE: LOSING YOUR INSURANCE

LOSING YOUR INSURANCE

There’s a big difference between an insurance company cancelling your policy and not renewing it.

Cancellation means either you or your insurance company stop the coverage before the policy’s normal expiration

date. You can always cancel your policy for any reason. In most states, when you’re a new policyholder, your

insurance company can cancel your policy for any reason, but only for a limited time (typically 60 days). After that,

there’s a limited number of reasons a company can cancel you, typically only if you don’t pay your premium or if you

were dishonest on your application.

If your insurance company cancels your policy, it must give you advance notice. The number of days’ notice varies

by state. If you or the insurer cancels your policy, the company may refund part of your premium.

Non-renewal means the company refuses to renew your policy after it expires. The expiration date is on your policy.

Insurance companies generally have the right to not renew your policy. If your company chooses to not renew your

policy, it must give you notice before your policy expires; the number of days (typically 30) varies by state. You should

ask the insurer for the reason, which state regulation may limit. You also may choose to not renew your auto policy.

If your insurance is canceled or non-renewed and you don’t agree with the insurance company’s explanation, contact

your state insurance department for advice.

WHAT TO DO IF YOU CAN’T FIND INSURANCE

If you’ve shopped around and still can’t find insurance, contact your state insurance department. Ask if your

state has an insurance program for high-risk drivers.

# 1) Scope & guardrails (the “rails”)

- **Jurisdictions & authority map:** states/provinces covered, which tasks require a licensed producer, what must be human-approved (binding, coverage reductions, cancellations, claim denials).
- **Consent & privacy:** what PII the bot may collect, retention windows, redaction rules, encryption posture.
- **Error & E&O safety:** “explain-back” confirmations, side-by-side quote comparisons, disclosure scripts, escalation triggers.
- **Provenance:** every fact tagged with source, effective date, and review cadence.

# 2) Core ontology (the “nouns & verbs”)

- **Entities:** Person/Business, Location, Vehicle/Property, Exposure, Policy, Coverage, Limit/Deductible, Endorsement, Carrier, Quote, Binder, COI/ACORD, Claim, Invoice, Payment, Renewal.
- **Relations:** “policy covers exposure,” “coverage modified by endorsement,” “carrier offers product in jurisdiction,” “claim linked to policy coverage,” etc.
- **Standard vocab:** ISO forms (e.g., CG 00 01), ACORD names, NAICS, class codes, protection class, roof material, crime/ISO territory.

# 3) Product & coverage knowledge (by line of business)

Personal: **Auto, Home/Condo/HO-3/HO-5, Renters, Umbrella, Toys (MC/boat/RV).**

Commercial: **BOP, GL, Property, Commercial Auto, Workers’ Comp, Cyber, EPLI, Professional/Tech E&O, Inland Marine.**

For each LOB include:

- **What it covers / not covered (exclusions).**
- **Required inputs for quoting** (e.g., for Auto: drivers’ MVR lookback, VINs, garaging, prior limits; for Home: replacement cost inputs, roof age/material, protection class).
- **Primary rating factors** and typical surcharges/credits.
- **Critical endorsements & gotchas** (e.g., Additional Insured, Waiver of Subrogation, Ordinance or Law, Water Backup, Loss Assessment, Cyber extortion sublimits).
- **Suitability rules** (who should/shouldn’t carry this and why).

# 4) Regulatory & jurisdiction rules

- **Minimums & mandates:** auto liability minimums, UM/UIM rules, PIP/MedPay states, SR-22/FR-44 details, evidence of insurance requirements.
- **Notice rules:** cancellation/non-renewal notice periods, binders validity, cooling-off periods.
- **Fees & taxes:** premium tax, stamping fees, surplus lines requirements.
- **Fairness/anti-discrimination constraints:** variables you must not use or infer.
- **Claim time bars:** reporting windows, comparative vs contributory negligence notes (where relevant).
    
    Tag everything by **state + effective date** and track superseded versions.
    

# 5) Carrier & market intelligence

- **Appetite matrix:** what each carrier will and won’t write by class, size, construction, age of roof, canine liability, vacancy, coastal/brush zones, radius of operation, etc.
- **Underwriting guidelines:** eligibility, loss-run thresholds, prior coverage requirements, deductible floors, photo/inspection rules.
- **Rates & filings pointers:** where the bot should fetch or reference changes (not storing proprietary rates; store *factors & rules*).
- **Portal workflows:** step-by-step for each carrier portal, document checklists, ACORD mapping.

# 6) Workflows (end-to-end playbooks)

- **Discovery & risk interview:** dynamic questions per line; red-flags and follow-ups.
- **Quoting & compare:** data normalization across carriers, like-for-like coverages, highlight deltas (sublimits, retro dates, occurrence vs claims-made).
- **Bind & issue:** binder issuance checklist, down payment & signatures, subjectivities.
- **COI & endorsements:** AI-safe rules for Additional Insured forms (CG 20 10 / 20 37), primary & non-contributory wording, certificate requests SLAs.
- **Renewals & remarketing:** loss-ratio triggers, premium change thresholds, re-shoppability rules.
- **Claims (FNOL → settlement):** intake script, coverage trigger checks, documentation list (photos, police reports, estimates), subrogation cues, reserve guidance.
- **Billing:** invoice schedules, EFT setup, late payment & reinstatement logic.

# 7) Conversation kits (how it talks like a pro)

- **Plain-language explanations** of every coverage and exclusion with one-line “why this matters.”
- **Trade-off explainers:** higher deductible vs premium savings, ACV vs replacement cost, hired/non-owned auto vs none.
- **Disclosure scripts:** where the bot must slow down and confirm understanding.
- **Escalation scripts:** when facts are ambiguous, risks are complex, or authority is exceeded.

# 8) Documents & data mapping

- **ACORD field maps** for 125/126/140/25/etc.
- **Evidence library:** sample policies, specimen forms, ISO excerpts (public/allowed portions), state bulletins.
- **Checklist templates:** new business, renewal review, claims documentation, inspection prep.
- **Glossary:** de-jargonized definitions.

# 9) Decision rules & calculators

- **Coverage recommendations** by exposure profile (home daycare? short-term rental? contractor with subs? coastal property? delivery radius > 200 miles?).
- **Limit calculators:** dwelling replacement cost helpers, umbrella limit heuristics (net worth, risk score, youthful drivers), cyber limit baselines (records held, revenue).
- **Eligibility gates:** kickouts (e.g., vacant > 60 days, knob-and-tube wiring without updates, DUI < 3 yrs).
- **Prioritization logic:** which market to try first, when to bundle, when to carve out (e.g., WC to state fund).

# 10) Evaluation, freshness & governance

- **SLAs & quality metrics:** quote accuracy, time-to-bind, % disclosures acknowledged, complaint rate, E&O incidents = 0.
- **Test set:** synthetic and real anonymized scenarios per line/state with expected outcomes.
- **Review cadence:** which tables refresh weekly vs monthly vs quarterly (regulatory tables monthly, carrier appetites quarterly, scripts as-needed).
-

(A) No policy forms, except as stated in section [3902.03](https://codes.ohio.gov/ohio-revised-code/section-3902.03) of the Revised Code, shall be delivered or issued for delivery in this state on or after the dates such forms must be approved under sections [3902.01](https://codes.ohio.gov/ohio-revised-code/section-3902.01) to [3902.08](https://codes.ohio.gov/ohio-revised-code/section-3902.08) of the Revised Code, unless:
(1) The text achieves a minimum score of forty on the Flesch reading ease test, or an equivalent score on any other comparable test as provided in division (C) of this section;
(2) It is printed, except for specification pages, schedules, and tables, in not less than ten-point type, one point leaded;
(3) The style, arrangement, and overall appearance of the policy give no undue prominence to any portion of the text of the policy, or to any endorsements or riders;
(4) It contains a table of contents or an index of the principal sections of the policy, if the policy has more than three thousand words printed on three or fewer pages of text, or if the policy has more than three pages regardless of the number of words.
(B) For the purposes of this section, a Flesch reading ease test score shall be measured by the following method:
(1) For policy forms containing ten thousand words or less of text, the entire form shall be analyzed. For policy forms containing more than ten thousand words, the readability of two two-hundred word samples per page may be analyzed instead of the entire form. The samples shall be separated by at least twenty printed lines.
(2) The number of words and sentences in the text shall be counted and the total number of words divided by the total number of sentences. The figure obtained shall be multiplied by a factor of one and fifteen thousandths.
(3) The total number of syllables shall be counted and divided by the total number of words. The figure obtained shall be multiplied by a factor of eighty-four and six-tenths.
(4) The sum of the figures computed under divisions (B)(2) and (3) of this section subtracted from two hundred six and eight hundred thirty-five thousandths equals the Flesch reading ease score for the policy form.
(5) For purposes of divisions (B)(2), (3), and (4) of this section, the following procedures shall be used:
(a) A contraction, hyphenated word, or numbers and letters, when separated by spaces, shall be counted as one word.
(b) A unit of words ending with a period, semicolon, or colon, but excluding headings and captions, shall be counted as a sentence.
(c) A syllable means a unit of spoken language consisting of one or more letters of a word as divided by an accepted dictionary. Where the dictionary shows two or more equally acceptable pronunciations of a word, the pronunciation containing fewer syllables may be used.
(6) As used in this section, "text" includes all printed matter, except the following:
(a) The name and address of the insurer, the name, number, or title of the policy, the table of contents or index, captions and subcaptions, specification pages, schedules, or tables;
(b) Any policy language that is drafted to conform to the requirements of any federal law, regulation, or agency interpretation; any policy language required by any collectively bargained agreement; any medical terminology; any words that are defined in the policy; and any policy language required by law or regulation; provided however, the insurer identifies the language or terminology excepted by this paragraph and certifies, in writing, that the language or terminology is entitled to be excepted by this paragraph.
(C) Any other reading test may be approved by the superintendent of insurance for use as an alternative to the Flesch reading ease test if it is comparable in result to the Flesch reading ease test.
(D) Every filing subject to this section shall be accompanied by a certificate signed by an officer of the insurer stating that the filing meets the minimum reading ease score on the test used, or stating that the score is lower than the minimum required but should be approved in accordance with section [3902.06](https://codes.ohio.gov/ohio-revised-code/section-3902.06) of the Revised Code. To confirm the accuracy of any certification, the superintendent may require the submission of further information to verify the certification in question.
(E) At the option of the insurer, riders, endorsements, applications, and other forms made a part of the policy may be scored as separate forms or as part of the policy with which they may be used.

When a plan of health coverage is primary, its benefits are paid without regard to the benefits of another plan. When a plan of health coverage is secondary, its benefits are determined by taking into consideration the payments made or to be made by another plan. When there are more than two plans, a plan may be primary as to one and may be secondary as to another.

(A) A plan of health coverage determines its order of benefits using the first of the following that applies:
(1) A plan that does not coordinate with other plans is always the primary plan.
(2) The benefits of the plan that covers a person as an employee, member, insured, or subscriber, other than a dependent, is the primary plan. The plan that covers the person as a dependent is the secondary plan.
(3) When more than one plan covers the same child as a dependent of different parents who are not divorced or separated, the primary plan is the plan of the parent whose birthday falls earlier in the year. The secondary plan is the plan of the parent whose birthday falls later in the year. If both parents have the same birthday, the benefits of the plan that covered the parent the longer is the primary plan. The plan that covered the parent the shorter time is the secondary plan. If the other plan's provision for coordination of benefits does not include the rule contained in this division because it is not subject to regulation under this division, but instead has a rule based on the gender of the parent, and if, as a result, the plans do not agree on the order of benefits, the rule of the other plan will determine the order of benefits.
(4)(a) Except as provided in division (A)(4)(b) of this section, if more than one plan covers a person as a dependent child of divorced or separated parents, benefits for the child are determined in the following order:
(i) The plan of the parent who is the residential parent and legal custodian of the child;
(ii) The plan of the spouse of the parent who is the residential parent and legal custodian of the child;
(iii) The plan of the parent who is not the residential parent and legal custodian of the child.
(b) If the specific terms of a court decree state that one parent is responsible for the health care expenses of the child, the plan of that parent is the primary plan. A parent responsible for the health care pursuant to a court decree must notify the insurer or health insuring corporation of the terms of the decree.
(5) The primary plan is the plan that covers a person as an employee who is neither laid off or retired, or that employee's dependent. The secondary plan is the plan that covers that person as a laid-off or retired employee, or that employee's dependent.
(6) If none of the rules in divisions (A)(1), (2), (3), (4), and (5) of this section determines the order of benefits, the primary plan is the plan that covered an employee, member, insured, or subscriber longer. The secondary plan is the plan that covered that person the shorter time.
(B) When a plan of health coverage is determined to be a secondary plan it acts to provide benefits in excess of those provided by the primary plan.
(C) The secondary plan shall not be required to make payment in an amount which exceeds the amount it would have paid if it were the primary plan, but in no event, when combined with the amount paid by the primary plan, shall payments by the secondary plan exceed one hundred per cent of expenses allowable under the provisions of the applicable policies and contracts.
(D) A third-party payer may require a beneficiary to file a claim with the primary plan before it determines the amount of its payment obligation, if any, with regard to that claim.
(E) Nothing in this section shall be construed to require a plan to make a payment until it determines whether it is the primary plan or the secondary plan and what benefits are payable under the primary plan.
(F) A plan may obtain any facts and information necessary to apply the provisions of this section, or supply this information to any other third-party payer or provider, or any agent of such third-party payer or provider, without the consent of the beneficiary. Each person claiming benefits under the plan shall provide any information necessary to apply the provisions of this section.
(G) If the amount of payments made by any plan is more than should have been paid, the plan may recover the excess from whichever party received the excess payment.
(H) No third-party payer shall administer a plan of health coverage delivered, issued for delivery, or renewed on or after June 29, 1988, unless such plan complies with this section.
(I)(1) A third-party payer that is subject to this section and has reason to believe payment has been made by another third-party payer for the same service may request from that third-party payer, and shall be provided by the third-party payer, such data as necessary to determine whether duplicate payment has been made.
(2) A third-party payer that meets the criteria of a secondary payer in accordance with this section may seek repayment of any duplicate payment that may have been made from the person to whom it made payment. If the person who received the duplicate payment is a provider, absent a finding of a court of competent jurisdiction that the provider has engaged in civil or criminal fraudulent activities, the request for the return of any duplicate payment shall be made within three years after the close of the provider's fiscal year in which the duplicate payment has been made.
(J) Nothing in this section shall be construed to affect the prohibition of section [3923.37](https://codes.ohio.gov/ohio-revised-code/section-3923.37) of the Revised Code.
(K)(1) No third-party payer shall knowingly fail to comply with the order of benefits as set forth in division (A) of this section.
(2) No primary plan shall direct or encourage an insured to use the benefits of a secondary plan that results in a reduction of payment by such primary plan.
(L) Whoever violates division (K) of this section is deemed to have engaged in an unfair and deceptive insurance act or practice under sections [3901.19](https://codes.ohio.gov/ohio-revised-code/section-3901.19) to [3901.26](https://codes.ohio.gov/ohio-revised-code/section-3901.26) of the Revised Code, and is subject to proceedings pursuant to those sections.

This amount shall be determined with reduction for cost sharing that generally applies under the health benefit plan with respect to out-of-network health care services.
(c) The amount that would be paid under the medicare program, part A or part B of Title XVIII of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. 1395, as amended, for the service in question, excluding any in-network cost sharing imposed under the health benefit plan.

(2) For emergency services provided at an out-of-network emergency facility in this state, neither the emergency facility nor an out-of-network provider shall bill a covered person for the difference between the health plan issuer's reimbursement and the emergency facility's or the provider's charge for the services.

(D) A health plan issuer shall not require cost sharing for any service described in division (A) of this section from the covered person at a rate higher than if the services were provided in network.
(E) For health care services, other than those described in division (A) of this section, that are covered under a health benefit plan but are provided to a covered person by an out-of-network provider at an in-network facility, both of the following apply:
(1) For services provided in this state, the provider shall not bill the covered person for the difference between the health plan issuer's out-of-network reimbursement and the provider's charge for the services unless all of the following conditions are met:

(2) The superintendent may revoke a license as a surety bail bond agent if the licensee is adjudged bankrupt.

(A) No person licensed under section [3905.30](https://codes.ohio.gov/ohio-revised-code/section-3905.30) of the Revised Code shall solicit, procure an application for, bind, issue, renew, or deliver a policy with any insurer that is not eligible to write insurance on an unauthorized basis in this state.
Pursuant to the "Nonadmitted and Reinsurance Reform Act of 2010," 15 U.S.C. 8201 et seq., 124 Stat. 1589, or any successor or replacement law, where this state is the home state of the insured, an insurer shall be considered eligible to write insurance on an unauthorized basis in this state if any of the following are true:
(1) The insurer meets the requirements and criteria in sections 5A(2) and 5C(2)(a) of the nonadmitted insurance model act adopted by the national association of insurance commissioners, or alternative nationwide uniform eligibility requirements adopted by this state through participation in a compact or other nationwide system pursuant to 15 U.S.C. 8201 et seq., 124 Stat. 1589.
(2) For unauthorized insurance placed with, or procured from an unauthorized insurer domiciled outside the United States, the insurer is listed on the quarterly listing of alien insurers maintained by the international insurers department of the national association of insurance commissioners.
(3) The insurer has been designated as a domestic surplus lines insurer pursuant to section [3905.332](https://codes.ohio.gov/ohio-revised-code/section-3905.332) of the Revised Code.
(B)(1) No surplus lines broker shall solicit, procure, place, or renew any insurance with an unauthorized insurer unless an agent or the surplus lines broker has complied with the due diligence requirements of this section and is unable to procure the requested insurance from an authorized insurer.
Due diligence requires an agent to contact at least five of the authorized insurers the agent represents, or as many insurers as the agent represents, that customarily write the kind of insurance required by the insured. Due diligence is presumed if declinations are received from each authorized insurer contacted. If any authorized insurer fails to respond within ten days after the initial contact, the agent may assume the insurer has declined to accept the risk.
(2) Due diligence shall only be performed by an agent licensed in this state that holds an active property and casualty insurance agent license.
(3) An insurance agent or surplus lines broker is exempt from the due diligence requirements of this section if the agent or surplus lines broker is procuring insurance from a risk purchasing group or risk retention group as provided in Chapter 3960. of the Revised Code.
(4) An insurance agent or surplus lines broker is exempt from the due diligence requirements of this section if the agent or surplus lines broker is seeking to procure or place unauthorized insurance for a person that qualifies as an exempt commercial purchaser under section [3905.331](https://codes.ohio.gov/ohio-revised-code/section-3905.331) of the Revised Code and both of the following are true:
(a) The surplus lines broker procuring or placing the surplus lines insurance has disclosed to the exempt commercial purchaser that the insurance may or may not be available from the authorized market that may provide greater protection with more regulatory oversight.
(b) After receipt of the disclosure required under division (B)(4)(a) of this section, the exempt commercial purchaser has requested in writing that the insurance agent or broker procure or place the insurance from an unauthorized insurer.
(C) Except when exempt from due diligence requirements under division (B) of this section, an insurance agent who procures or places insurance through a surplus lines broker shall obtain a signed statement from the insured acknowledging that the insurance policy is to be placed with a company or insurer not authorized to do business in this state and acknowledging that, in the event of the insolvency of the insurer, the insured is not entitled to any benefits or proceeds from the Ohio insurance guaranty association. The statement must be on a form prescribed by the superintendent and need not be notarized. The agent shall submit the original signed statement to the surplus lines broker within thirty days after the effective date of the policy. If no other agent is involved, the surplus lines broker shall obtain the statement from the insured.
The surplus lines broker shall maintain the original signed statement or a copy of the statement, and the originating agent shall keep a copy of the statement, for at least five years after the effective date of the policy to which the statement pertains. A copy of the signed statement shall be given to the insured at the time the insurance is bound or a policy is delivered.
(D) For the purpose of carrying out the "Nonadmitted and Reinsurance Reform Act of 2010," 124 Stat. 1589, 15 U.S.C. 8201 et seq., or any successor or replacement law, the superintendent shall conduct a fiscal analysis of the impact of entering into a multistate agreement or compact for determining eligibility for placement of unauthorized insurance and for payment, reporting, collection, and allocation of the tax on unauthorized insurance. If the fiscal analysis indicates that entering into a multistate agreement or compact is advantageous to this state, the superintendent may enter into the surplus lines insurance multistate compliance compact adopted by the national conference of insurance legislators and known as "SLIMPACT," as amended on December 21, 2010, and including any subsequent amendment; or, if it is in this state's financial best interest, the superintendent shall request that the general assembly authorize the superintendent to enter into a different multistate agreement or compact.
(E) The superintendent may adopt rules in accordance with Chapter 119. of the Revised Code to carry out the purposes of sections [3905.30](https://codes.ohio.gov/ohio-revised-code/section-3905.30) to [3905.38](https://codes.ohio.gov/ohio-revised-code/section-3905.38) of the Revised Code.

(E) An agent aggrieved by the conduct of an insurer in its breach or termination of a contract of agency may file with the superintendent a request that the superintendent review the action to determine whether it is in accord with this section and the lawful provisions of the contract of agency and send a copy of the request to the insurer at the address of the office issuing the notice of termination. Upon receipt of such a request, an insurer shall promptly provide the independent insurance agent and superintendent with documentation in support of the insurer's stated reason for termination.
(F) The superintendent shall promptly investigate the allegation. If the superintendent has reasonable cause to believe that this section or the lawful provisions of the contract of agency have been violated, the superintendent shall, within thirty days of receipt of a request for review, conduct an adjudication hearing subject to Chapter 119. of the Revised Code, held upon not less than ten days' written notice to the agent and the insurer. Pending a final order in the adjudication hearing, the superintendent may take such interim action as necessary to protect the parties or the public. During the pendency of the proceeding before the superintendent, the contract of agency subject to the proceeding continues in force and division (C) of this section applies. The superintendent shall, within thirty days following such hearing, issue an order approving or disapproving the action of the insurer. All final orders and decisions of the superintendent are subject to judicial review as provided in Chapter 119. of the Revised Code.
(G) An insurer shall not cancel or nonrenew any policy of insurance written through an agent upon the sole ground of the termination of the agency until the expiration of the policy term or the twelve-month period following the effective date of the termination of the contract of agency, whichever is earlier. However, during such period, an independent insurance agent may, subject to the current underwriting rules, guidelines, commission rates, and practices of the insurer, effect any necessary changes or endorsements to outstanding policies of insurance that are in force prior to the date of termination.
This section does not abridge, restrict, or supersede the rights of an agent to the ownership of expirations provided for in any contract with an insurer.
(H) Any information or documentation provided to an agent or the superintendent by an insurer under this section is confidential and shall be used by the superintendent only in the exercise of the proper functions authorized by this section. No insurer is liable for furnishing information or documentation in compliance with this section if the insurer acts without malice and in the reasonable belief that such information or documentation is warranted by this section.
(I) Notwithstanding division (H) of this section, the superintendent may do either of the following:
(1) Share the information or documentation that is the subject of this section with the chief deputy rehabilitator, the chief deputy liquidator, other deputy rehabilitators and liquidators, and any other person employed by, or acting on behalf of, the superintendent pursuant to Chapter 3901. or 3903. of the Revised Code, with other local, state, federal, and international regulatory and law enforcement agencies, with local, state, and federal prosecutors, and with the national association of insurance commissioners and its affiliates and subsidiaries, provided that the recipient agrees to maintain the confidential status of the confidential information or documentation and has authority to do so;
(2) Disclose any information or documentation that is the subject of this section in the furtherance of any regulatory or legal action brought by or on behalf of the superintendent or the state, resulting from the exercise of the superintendent's official duties.
(J) Notwithstanding divisions (H) and (I) of this section, the superintendent may authorize the national association of insurance commissioners and its affiliates and subsidiaries by agreement to share confidential information and documentation received pursuant to division (I)(1) of this section with local, state, federal, and international regulatory and law enforcement agencies and with local, state, and federal prosecutors, provided that the recipient agrees to maintain the confidential status of the confidential information or documentation and has authority to do so.
(K) Notwithstanding divisions (H) and (I) of this section, the chief deputy rehabilitator, the chief deputy liquidator, and other deputy rehabilitators and liquidators may disclose information and documentation that is the subject of this section in the furtherance of any regulatory or legal action brought by or on behalf of the superintendent, the rehabilitator, the liquidator, or the state resulting from the exercise of the superintendent's official duties in any capacity.
(L) Nothing in this section shall prohibit the superintendent from receiving information and documentation in accordance with section [3901.045](https://codes.ohio.gov/ohio-revised-code/section-3901.045) of the Revised Code.
(M) The superintendent may enter into agreements governing the sharing and use of information and documentation consistent with the requirements of this section.
(N)(1) No waiver of any applicable privilege or claim of confidentiality in the information and documentation that is the subject of this section shall occur as a result of sharing or receiving information and documentation as authorized in divisions (I)(1), (J), and (L) of this section.
(2) The disclosure of information or documentation in connection with a regulatory or legal action pursuant to divisions (I)(2) and (K) of this section does not prohibit an insurer or any other person from taking steps to limit the dissemination of the information or documentation to persons not involved in or the subject of the regulatory or legal action on the basis of any recognized privilege arising under any other section of the Revised Code or the common law.
The Legislative Service Commission presents the text of this section as a composite of the section as amended by multiple acts of the General Assembly. This presentation recognizes the principle stated in [R.C. 1.52(B)](https://codes.ohio.gov/ohio-revised-code/section-1.52) that amendments are to be harmonized if reasonably capable of simultaneous operation.

(A) If, in any calendar year, the aggregate amount of gross written premium on business placed with a controlled insurer by a controlling producer is equal to or greater than five per cent of the admitted assets of the insurer, as reported in the insurer's quarterly statement filed as of the thirtieth day of September of the immediately preceding year, all of the following apply:
(1) The controlled insurer shall not accept business from the controlling producer and the controlling producer shall not place business with the controlled insurer, unless there is a written contract between the producer and the insurer specifying the responsibilities of each party, which contract has been approved by the board of directors of the insurer and contains at least the following provisions:
(a) The insurer may terminate the contract for cause, upon written notice to the producer. The insurer shall suspend the authority of the producer to write business during the pendency of any dispute regarding the cause of the termination.
(b) The producer shall render accounts to the insurer detailing all material transactions, including information necessary to support all commissions, charges, and other fees received by, or owing to, the producer.
(c) The producer shall remit all funds due under the terms of the contract to the insurer on at least a monthly basis. The due date shall be fixed so that premiums or installments thereof collected shall be remitted no later than ninety days after the effective date of any policy placed with the insurer under the contract.
(d) All funds collected for the insurer's account shall be held by the producer, in a fiduciary capacity, in one or more appropriately identified bank accounts in banks that are members of the federal reserve system, in accordance with any applicable provisions of Title XXIX of the Revised Code. Funds of a controlling producer that is not required to be licensed in this state shall be maintained in compliance with the requirements of the producer's domiciliary jurisdiction.
(e) The producer shall maintain separate, identifiable records of business written for the insurer.
(f) The contract shall not be assigned in whole or in part by the producer.
(g) The insurer shall provide the producer with copies of its underwriting standards, rules, and procedures and manuals setting forth the rates to be charged and the conditions for the acceptance or rejection of risks. The producer shall adhere to these standards, rules, procedures, rates, and conditions. The standards, rules, procedures, rates, and conditions shall be the same as those applicable to comparable business placed with the insurer by a producer that is not a controlling producer. For purposes of divisions (A)(1)(g) and (h) of this section, "comparable business" includes the same lines of insurance, same kinds of insurance, same kinds of risks, similar policy limits, and similar quality of business.
(h) The rates and terms of the producer's commissions, charges, or other fees and the purposes for the charges or fees. The rates of the commissions, charges, or other fees shall not be greater than those applicable to comparable business placed with the insurer by producers that are not controlling producers.
(i) If the contract provides that the producer's compensation on insurance business placed with the insurer is contingent upon the insurer's profits on that business, the compensation shall not be determined and paid until at least five years after the premiums on liability insurance are earned and at least one year after the premiums on any other insurance are earned. In no event shall the commissions be paid until the adequacy of the insurer's reserves on remaining claims has been independently verified pursuant to division (A)(3) of this section.
(j) A limit on the producer's writings in relation to the insurer's surplus and total writings. The insurer may establish a different limit for each line or subline of business. The insurer shall notify the producer when the applicable limit is approached and shall not accept business from the producer if the limit is reached. The producer shall not place business with the insurer if it has been notified by the insurer that the limit has been reached.
(k) The producer may negotiate, but shall not bind, reinsurance on behalf of the insurer on business the producer places with the insurer, except that the producer may bind facultative reinsurance contracts pursuant to obligatory facultative agreements if the contract with the insurer contains underwriting guidelines including, for both reinsurance assumed and ceded, a list of reinsurers with which such automatic agreements are in effect, the coverages and amounts or percentages that may be reinsured, and commission schedules.
(2) Each controlled insurer shall have an audit committee of the board of directors composed of independent directors. The audit committee shall annually meet with management, the insurer's independent certified public accountants, and an independent casualty actuary, or other independent loss reserves specialist acceptable to the superintendent of insurance, to review the adequacy of the insurer's loss reserves.
(3) On or before the first day of April, the controlled insurer shall annually file with the superintendent, in addition to any other required loss reserve certification, the opinion of an independent casualty actuary, or any other independent loss reserve specialist acceptable to the superintendent, that reports the loss ratios for each line of business written by the insurer and that, with respect to all business placed with the insurer by the producer, attests to the adequacy of loss reserves established for losses incurred and outstanding, including incurred but not reported, as of the previous thirty-first day of December.
(4) On or before the first day of April, the insurer shall annually report to the superintendent the amount of commissions paid by the insurer to the producer, the percentage that such amount represents of the net premiums written by the insurer, the amount of commissions paid by the insurer to each producer that is not in control of the insurer for the placement of the same kind of insurance, and the percentage that such amount represents of the net premiums written by the insurer.
(B) Division (A) of this section does not apply if both of the following conditions are met:
(1) The controlling producer places insurance only with the controlled insurer, with the insurer and a member or members of the insurer's holding company system, or with the insurer's parent, affiliate, or subsidiary; receives no compensation that is based on the amount of premiums written in connection with the insurance; and accepts insurance placed by nonaffiliated subproducers and not directly from insureds.
(2) The controlled insurer, except for insurance business written through a residual market facility, accepts insurance business only from a controlling producer, a producer controlled by the insurer, or a producer that is a subsidiary of the insurer.

(A) A surety bail bond agent that accepts collateral security or other indemnity shall comply with all of the following requirements:
(1) The collateral security or other indemnity shall be reasonable in relation to the amount of the bond.
(2) The collateral security or other indemnity shall not be used by the surety bail bond agent for personal benefit or gain and shall be returned in the same condition as received.
(3) Acceptable forms of collateral security or indemnity include cash or its equivalent, a promissory note, an indemnity agreement, a real property mortgage in the name of the surety, and any filing under Chapter 1309. of the Revised Code. If the surety bail bond agent accepts on a bond collateral security in excess of fifty thousand dollars in cash, the cash amount shall be made payable to the surety in the form of a cashier's check, United States postal money order, certificate of deposit, or wire transfer.
(4) The surety bail bond agent shall provide to the person giving the collateral security or other indemnity, a written, numbered receipt that describes in a detailed manner the collateral security or other indemnity received, along with copies of any documents rendered.
(5) The collateral security or other indemnity shall be received and held in the surety's name by the surety bail bond agent in a fiduciary capacity and, prior to any forfeiture of bail, shall be kept separate and apart from any other funds or assets of the surety bail bond agent. However, when collateral security in excess of fifty thousand dollars in cash or its equivalent is received on a bond, the surety bail bond agent promptly shall forward the entire amount to the surety or managing general agent.
(B) Collateral security may be placed in an interest-bearing account in a federally insured bank or savings and loan association in this state, to accrue to the benefit of the person giving the collateral security. The surety bail bond agent, surety, or managing general agent shall not make any pecuniary gain on the collateral security deposited.
(C)(1) The surety is liable for all collateral security or other indemnity accepted by a surety bail bond agent. If, upon final termination of liability on a bond, the surety bail bond agent or managing general agent fails to return the collateral security to the person that gave it, the surety shall return the actual collateral to that person or, in the event that the surety cannot locate the collateral, shall pay the person in accordance with this section.
(2) A surety's liability as described in division (C)(1) of this section survives the termination of the surety bail bond agent's appointment, with respect to those bonds that were executed by the surety bail bond agent prior to the termination of the appointment.
(D) If a forfeiture occurs, the surety bail bond agent or surety shall give the principal and the person that gave the collateral security ten days' written notice of intent to convert the collateral deposit into cash to satisfy the forfeiture. The notice shall be sent by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the last known address of the principal and the person that gave the collateral.
The surety bail bond agent or surety shall convert the collateral deposit into cash within a reasonable period of time and return that which is in excess of the face value of the bond minus the actual and reasonable expenses of converting the collateral into cash. In no event shall these expenses exceed ten per cent of the face value of the bond. However, upon motion and proof that the actual and reasonable expenses exceed ten per cent, the court may allow recovery of the full amount of the actual and reasonable expenses. If there is a remission of forfeiture that required the surety to pay the bond to the court, the surety shall pay to the person that gave the collateral the value of any collateral received for the bond minus the actual and reasonable expenses permitted to be recovered under this division.
(E) A surety bail bond agent or surety shall not solicit or accept a waiver of any of the provisions of this section, or enter into any agreement as to the value of the collateral.
(F) No person shall fail to comply with this section.

(A) No insurer, managing general agent, or surety bail bond agent shall furnish to any person any blank form, application, stationery, business card, or other supplies to be used in soliciting, negotiating, or effecting bail bonds unless the person is licensed to act as a surety bail bond agent and is appointed by an insurer. This division does not prohibit an unlicensed employee, under the direct supervision and control of a licensed and appointed surety bail bond agent, from possessing or executing in the surety bond office, any form, other than a power of attorney, bond form, or collateral receipt, while acting within the scope of the employee's employment.
(B) An insurer that furnishes any of the supplies mentioned in division (A) of this section to any surety bail bond agent or other person not appointed by an insurer and that accepts any bail bond business from or writes any bail bond business for that surety bail bond agent or other person is liable on the bond to the same extent and in the same manner as if the surety bail bond agent or other person had been appointed or authorized by an insurer to act in its behalf.

ABOUT THE NAIC

The National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) is the oldest association of state government officials.

Its members consist of the chief insurance regulators in all 50 states, the District of Columbia and five U.S. territories.

The primary responsibility of the state regulators is to protect the interests of insurance consumers, and the NAIC

helps regulators fulfill that obligation in a number of different ways. This guide is one example of work done by the

NAIC to assist states in educating and protecting consumers.

Another way the NAIC lends support to state regulators is by providing a forum for the development of uniform public

policy when uniformity is appropriate. It does this through a series of model laws, regulations and guidelines,

developed for the states’ use. States that choose to do so may adopt the models intact or modify them to meet the

needs of their marketplace and consumers.

The NAIC’s mission is to assist state insurance regulators, individually and collectively, in serving the public interest

and achieving the following fundamental insurance regulatory goals in a responsive, efficient and cost effective

manner, consistent with the wishes of its members:

- ****Protect the public interest.
- ****Promote competitive markets.
- ****Facilitate the fair and equitable treatment of insurance consumers.
- ****Promote the reliability, solvency and financial solidity of insurance institutions.
- ****Support and improve state regulation of insurance.

2022 NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF INSURANCE COMMISSIONERSA CONSUMER’S GUIDE TO HOME INSURANCE: WHY YOU NEED INSURANCE

WHY YOU NEED INSURANCE

Homeowners insurance is an important purchase for many people. There are two major reasons to buy homeowners

insurance:

To protect your assets

Homeowners insurance covers the structure of your home and your personal property, as well as your personal legal

responsibility (or liability) for injuries to others or their property while they’re on your property.

To satisfy your mortgage lender

Most mortgage lenders require you to have insurance as long as you have a mortgage and to list them as the

mortgagee on the policy. If you let your insurance lapse, your mortgage lender will likely have your home insured.

Compared to a policy you would buy on your own, the premium might be much higher and the coverage will be limited

to damage to the structure of your home. The lender can require you to pay this higher premium until you get your

own homeowners insurance again.

COVERAGES IN A HOMEOWNERS POLICY

Most homeowners insurance policies provide a package of coverages. The main types of coverage are described

below. Keep in mind that you’re covered only if the loss is caused by a peril your policy covers. For example, if your

home becomes unlivable due to an earthquake and your homeowners policy doesn’t cover earthquakes, your policy

won’t pay for loss of use of your home. Review your policy for the limits of your coverage.

- Dwelling. Pays for damage to your house and to structures attached to your house. This includes damage

to fixtures, such as plumbing, electrical wiring, heating and permanently installed air-conditioning systems.

- Other Structures. Pays for damage to fences, tool sheds, freestanding garages, guest cottages and other

structures not attached to your house.

- Personal Property. Reimburses you for the value of your possessions, including furniture, electronics,

appliances and clothing, damaged or lost even when they aren’t on your property, such as those at an off-

site storage locker or with your child at college.

- Loss of Use. Pays some of your additional living expenses while your home is being repaired.
- Personal Liability. Covers your financial loss if you are sued and found legally responsible for injuries or

damages to someone else.

- Medical Payments. Pays medical bills for people hurt on your property or hurt by your pets.

Peril is an insurance term for a specific risk or reason for a loss. Some policies cover all perils except ones

specifically excluded. At the other extreme are policies that cover only the perils named in the policy.

TYPES OF HOMEOWNERS POLICIES

To be reimbursed for damage to your property, a covered peril (such as fire, theft or windstorm) must have caused

your loss. Which perils your policy covers depends on the type of policy you buy. The most common types of

homeowners policies are listed below. All of the policy types except the dwelling fire form cover your dwelling and its

contents, as well as personal liability and medical payments. Read Table 1 to learn the specific perils each type of

policy covers.

2022 NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF INSURANCE COMMISSIONERS 1A CONSUMER’S GUIDE TO HOME INSURANCE: TYPES OF POLICIES

A type of homeowners policy is called Form

- The Dwelling Fire Form covers only your dwelling. It does not cover your personal property, personal

liability or medical payments. It also covers only a few perils. It’s the type of policy your mortgage lender will

buy for you if you let your homeowners policy lapse. It’s also used for vacation homes and when you can’t

find other coverage.

- The Basic Form insures your property against only the list of perils shown in Table 1.
- The Modified Coverage Form is for older homes, where the cost to rebuild is greater than the market value.

It covers the same set of perils as the Basic Form.

- The Broad Form insures your property against the perils shown on Table 1.
- The Special Form is the most popular of all homeowners forms. It insures your property against all perils,

except those the policy specifically names as not covered. Perils commonly excluded are flood and

earthquake.

- The Tenants Form is for renters. It insures your personal property against all of the perils in the Broad Form.
- The Condominium Unit Owners Form is for owner-occupants of condominium units. It insures your personal

property and your walls, floors and ceiling against all of the perils in the Broad Form.

There are other types of insurance for other types of residences. If you own a townhouse, you may insure it through

either an individual homeowners policy or an association master policy. If you live in a mobile home that has wheels

and doesn’t rest on blocks or a permanent foundation, in most states you’ll buy a form of automobile insurance. This

insurance offers far less coverage than homeowners policies. If your home is on land used for farming or raising

livestock, ask about a farmowners policy.

2022 NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF INSURANCE COMMISSIONERS 2A CONSUMER’S GUIDE TO HOME INSURANCE: TYPES OF POLICIES

Flood Insurance

Homeowners policies don’t cover flood damage. Depending on where your home is, you may qualify for flood

insurance through the National Flood Insurance Program or through a private insurer. Contact an insurance

agent for more information. If your home is in a flood plain, your mortgage lender will usually require you to

buy flood insurance.

2022 NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF INSURANCE COMMISSIONERS 3A CONSUMER’S GUIDE TO HOME INSURANCE: LIMITS/DEDUCTIBLES

LIMITS OF COVERAGE

Your insurance agent usually will help you decide how much dwelling coverage to buy when you first get homeowners

insurance. Your coverage should equal the full replacement cost of your home. Note that replacement cost and

market value are not the same. The market value, which includes the price of your land, depends on the real estate

market.

You should review your dwelling coverage from time to time to be sure it doesn’t drop below the cost to replace

your home. If it drops below 80% of the full replacement cost of your home, your insurance company may reduce

the amount that it will pay on a claim.

The limits of your coverage for other structures, for personal property and for loss of use of your home are expressed

as percentages of your dwelling limit. The coverage is usually a set percentage (see Table 2). For example, if your

dwelling coverage limit is $150,000 and your coverage for personal property is limited to 50% of your dwelling

coverage, your coverage for personal property would be $75,000. Check your policy, as coverage limits might be based

on percentages different from those in Table 2. You choose your coverage limits for your personal liability and for

medical payments.

Table 2. Policy Limits

Coverage Component Typical Limit of Coverage

Dwelling You Choose

Other Structures 10% of Dwelling Coverage Limit

Personal Property 50% of Dwelling Coverage Limit

Loss of Use 20% of Dwelling Coverage Limit

Personal Liability You Choose

Medical Payments You Choose

DEDUCTIBLES

A deductible is the money you have to pay out-of-pocket on a claim before the policy pays the loss. The deductible

applies to coverage for your home and personal property and is paid on each claim. Higher policy deductibles mean

lower policy premiums. A policy with a $1,000 deductible will have a lower premium than the same policy with a $500

deductible. In some locations, there are also catastrophe deductibles, which are expressed as a percentage instead

of a dollar amount.

Having a higher deductible can be a good way to save money on your homeowners insurance premium and to submit

fewer claims. However, be sure you can afford the deductible in case you have a loss.

Replacement Cost and Actual Cash Value

You can choose to insure your home and its contents for either replacement cost or actual cash value.

Replacement cost is the cost to rebuild your home or repair damages using materials of similar kind and quality.

2022 NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF INSURANCE COMMISSIONERS 4A CONSUMER’S GUIDE TO HOME INSURANCE: OPTIONAL COVERAGES

Actual cash value is the value of your home considering its age and wear and tear. Actual cash value coverage

pays you for your loss, but often doesn’t pay enough to fully repair or replace the damage.

OPTIONAL COVERAGES

You can add other coverages. Sometimes, you can add coverage by buying an endorsement; other times, you must

buy another policy to cover a specific peril or a specific item of property. Some reasons you might want to add

coverages are:

- To cover perils most homeowners policies don’t cover. The National Flood Insurance Program writes most flood

insurance policies, although some insurance companies also sell it. Many insurance companies sell earthquake

insurance as a separate policy or as an endorsement to your homeowners policy. While homeowners policies in

most states cover damage caused by windstorm and hail, policies in coastal areas often exclude this coverage, in

which case you would need to buy a separate policy to protect from this risk. You might be able to buy

endorsements to cover damage caused by mold or by sewer or drain backups and sump pump overflow since

most homeowners policies offer limited or no coverage for these types of events.

- To increase your current coverage. Guaranteed replacement cost coverage pays to completely rebuild your

home, while a personal property replacement cost endorsement pays to replace your personal property. An

inflation guard endorsement raises your dwelling coverage limit annually in line with inflation. Personal umbrella

liability insurance increases your liability coverage above the level available in a homeowners policy. A scheduled

personal property endorsement (or “personal article floater”) covers jewelry, furs, stamps, coins, guns,

computers, antiques and other items whose value might be greater than the normal limits in your

homeowners policy. An ordinance or law endorsement pays for the extra expense to rebuild your home in

compliance with building codes and other ordinances or laws that didn’t exist when your home was originally

built.

BUSINESS USE OF YOUR HOME

While homeowners insurance isn’t designed to cover most business uses of your home, some policies might cover

some business uses, at least partially. For example:

- Computers and laptops. If you use your home computer or laptop for business purposes, it’s often covered,

but you should check your policy limits. Your laptop might be covered, even if it’s lost, damaged or stolen

when it’s away from your home.

- Daycare coverage. Most homeowners policies provide a limited amount of liability coverage if you care for a

friend’s children and aren’t paid. But if you’re paid to provide daycare in your home, you must buy more

insurance to cover your related liability.

OTHER TYPES OF HOME-RELATED INSURANCE

You might hear about other types of insurance, especially when you buy your home. Lenders usually require private

mortgage insurance (PMI) if your down payment is less than 20% of the home’s purchase price. PMI protects the

lender if you default on your mortgage. The PMI premium is often included in your monthly mortgage payment.

2022 NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF INSURANCE COMMISSIONERS 5A CONSUMER’S GUIDE TO HOME INSURANCE: OTHER HOME-RELATED INSURANCE

Title insurance protects you and the lender against any monetary loss due to errors in the title. You usually pay for

title insurance as a one-time fee when you buy a home.

A home warranty covers the mechanical breakdown of individual parts of a home, such as the electrical and plumbing

systems. A warranty doesn’t cover the home’s structure, may or may not cover appliances, ends at a specific point in

time (for example, one year) and has exclusions and limitations that you should review. Home warranties might not

be regulated as insurance in your state.

2022 NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF INSURANCE COMMISSIONERS 6A CONSUMER’S GUIDE TO HOME INSURANCE: DETERMINING YOUR PREMIUM

HOW INSURERS DETERMINE YOUR PREMIUM

Many factors affect the premium you pay, including which insurance company you choose. Different insurance

companies charge different premiums for similar coverage. Decisions you make about how much insurance coverage

to buy also affect your premium. Some of the other things that are likely to affect your premium are:

The characteristics of your home

- The cost to rebuild your home. This is not the same as the purchase price (which includes the cost of the

land). Your insurance agent might help you estimate replacement cost using information about your home

and its contents.

- Whether your home is made of brick or wood. The premium usually is lower for homes that are primarily

brick or masonry than for wood frame homes.

- The distance from your home to a water source or fire department and the quality of your community’s fire

protection services.

- The age and condition of your home. The premium often is higher for older homes and homes in poor

condition than for newer homes and homes in good condition.

- The claims history of your home and of homes in your area.

Your choices and characteristics

- The coverages you choose, including optional endorsements.
- The deductible you choose.
- Insuring your home and autos with the same insurance company.
- The length of time you’ve been with your current insurance company.
- Your credit history. To access your credit report, the insurance agent might ask you for your Social Security

number. In many states, insurers use your credit history as a factor to decide whether to sell you insurance

and what price to charge you.

- Your history of filing claims for water damage, fire, theft or liability on homes you’ve owned.

Other characteristics

- Having protection devices in your home, such as smoke detectors, a burglar alarm, a sprinkler system,

deadbolts on doors or security devices for windows. Many insurers offer a discount if you have any of these.

- Having a wood furnace or wood stove.
- Having a swimming pool, trampoline or playscape that could cause injuries.
- The types of pets you have. Some insurers won’t insure you if you own certain breeds of dogs.
- Operating a business from your home.

2022 NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF INSURANCE COMMISSIONERS 7A CONSUMER’S GUIDE TO HOME INSURANCE: SMART SHOPPING

SMART SHOPPING

Different insurance companies charge different rates for the same coverage. Also, not all insurance companies

provide the same level of claims service. Therefore, it makes sense to shop around for the best insurance company

for your needs.

Insurance companies use one of three methods to sell their products.

- Independent agents represent several companies and can give you several quotes.
- Exclusive agents only sell the products of one insurance company.
- Direct market sales are over the Internet or by mail or telephone.

You can find insurance companies and agents through the phone book, on the Internet and television and by asking

friends and neighbors. You should also check with your state insurance department to see if it publishes premium

comparison guides for homeowners insurance.

Customer service is important to most consumers, particularly when they have a claim. You can get a sense of how well

an insurer serves its customers from a complaint index. Many state insurance departments post complaint index

information on their Web sites. A complaint index measures how many complaints your state insurance department

receives relative to the size of the company.

It’s illegal for unlicensed insurers or agents to sell insurance. Business cards aren’t proof that an agent is

licensed. If you do business with an unlicensed agent or company, it might not pay your claims or refund your

premiums if you cancel your policy. If an unlicensed agent or company contacts you, check with your state

insurance department immediately, so it can investigate. Your actions may protect someone else from being

victimized.

You also want to buy insurance from a company that’s financially sound. You can check the financial health of an

insurance company by using ratings from independent ratings agencies such as Standard and Poor’s, A.M. Best and

Moody’s.

2022 NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF INSURANCE COMMISSIONERS 8A CONSUMER’S GUIDE TO HOME INSURANCE: GETTING PREMIUM QUOTES

GETTING PREMIUM QUOTES

Getting premium quotes is a good way to compare different companies’ prices. But, first you should decide what

coverages and policy limits you need. It’s important that you know how much it would cost to rebuild your home. An

insurance agent or a contractor might be able to help you estimate the cost to rebuild your home.

When you get quotes, it’s crucial that you ask for the same coverages and limits and give the same information to

each agent or company. To give you an accurate quote, the insurance agent or company will usually ask for a

description of your house (such as where it’s located, its square footage, when it was built and the type of

construction). He or she also might ask about items that increase your insurance needs, such as owning pets and

expensive possessions. An agent might visit your home to take a photo or ask you for other information (such as the

distance from the nearest fire department and the general condition of your home). Be sure to get rate quotes and key

information in writing.

Make sure you ask the insurance agent if you qualify for any discounts. Some insurers offer a discount if you also buy

your auto insurance from them or if you disaster-proof your home (for example, add storm shutters), update the

home’s electrical or plumbing systems, get a new roof or add home security devices (for example, a burglar alarm).

Also, be sure to find out how much your premium will change if you choose different deductibles.

While you’re getting quotes, you should also ask the agent some of these questions:

- Are the agent and the insurance company licensed by my state insurance department? For how long? (Your

state insurance department can confirm the answers to these questions.)

- How can I find out the claims history of the home before I buy it? The claims history of the home might

affect your premium.

- If I submit a claim, how will it affect my premium when I renew the policy?
- How will my credit history affect my premium?
- What does the policy cover? What doesn’t it cover? What are the limits to the coverages?
- How much coverage do I need for my personal property?
- How much liability coverage should I buy?
- Should I buy flood insurance or earthquake coverage? Your homeowners insurance policy doesn’t

cover either.

- What types of water damage are not covered? Is mold damage covered?

If you’re thinking of buying a home, you can ask an agent to estimate the cost of insurance.

2022 NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF INSURANCE COMMISSIONERS 9A CONSUMER’S GUIDE TO HOME INSURANCE: YOUR RESPONSIBILITIES

YOUR RESPONSIBILITIES

A homeowners insurance policy is a legal contract. It’s written so that your rights and responsibilities, and those of

the insurance company, are clearly stated. You should read your policy and be sure you understand it. If you have

questions about your insurance policy, contact your insurance agent or company.

When you buy homeowners insurance, you will receive a policy—not a photocopy. If you don’t receive a policy within

30 days, contact the insurance company, not the agent. If you need a company’s toll-free number, contact your state

insurance department.

Keep your policy in a safe place and know the name of your insurer. If you still have questions, contact your state

insurance department.

Other helpful tips:

- Pay the premium on time. Most insurers don’t offer a grace period for paying the premium; the due date is

the due date.

- Keep a file of all paperwork you completed online or received in the mail and signed—as well as any other

documents related to your insurance, including the policy, correspondence, copies of advertisements,

premium payment receipts, notes of conversations and any claims submitted.

- Make a household inventory.

o Go through each room; write down and take pictures or videos of everything in the room.

o Inventory everything, including valuable items such as antiques, electronics, jewelry, collectibles and

guns.

o Store your home inventory in a secure place at another location, such as your workplace, a safe deposit

box, a relative’s house or online.

o Annually review and update your home inventory, including your pictures/videos. Also update

your inventory when you buy new items.

o Keep receipts with your home inventory for all repairs and new items you buy, for proof if you file a

claim.

- Maintain your home.

o A homeowners policy isn’t a maintenance contract; it insures against damage from perils such as fire,

wind and hail. It doesn’t pay to repair items that simply wear out, like rotted porch railings. You’re

responsible for the upkeep of your home, such as repairing your roof when it begins to leak or cleaning

your chimney flue so it doesn’t catch fire.

2022 NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF INSURANCE COMMISSIONERS 10A CONSUMER’S GUIDE TO HOME INSURANCE: FILING A CLAIM

FILING A CLAIM

Read your policy—it’s your guide to the types of losses that may or may not be covered. How often you file a claim and

the types of claims you file often affect your premium and whether your insurer will renew your policy. If the cost to

repair the damage is not much more than your deductible, you might want to pay for the repairs without filing a claim.

Most insurance companies report your homeowners claims to private nationwide claim databases (such as the

Comprehensive Loss Underwriting Exchange, better known as CLUE). Insurance companies use these databases

to see the claims you’ve submitted in the past.

To file a claim, contact your insurance agent or company as soon as possible. Ask about forms or documents you’ll need

to support your claim. You’re also required to protect your home from further damage. For example, you might need

to board it up or clean up water from a backed-up drain.

The insurance company will assign a claims adjuster to assess the damages and determine the payment. These

adjusters may be employees of the company or independent contractors. You should cooperate with the adjuster’s

investigation of your claim. The adjuster will probably want to meet with you at your house to inspect the damage.

Jot down notes and keep track of the dates of any conversations you have with your insurance agent or adjuster.

If there are disagreements between you, the insurer and the claims adjuster, first try to resolve them with your

insurer. Don’t feel rushed or pushed to agree with something you aren’t comfortable with. It might help to have

your contractor meet with you and the insurance adjuster.

If you and the insurer still disagree about the value of the claim, check your policy for an appraisal clause. Another

option is to hire an attorney or a public adjuster.

Public adjusters aren’t attorneys or government employees – they’re freelance adjusters that charge you a fee.

Not all states allow public adjusters, but those that do require them to be licensed and to follow certain

guidelines. If you have questions about the use public adjusted, contact your state insurance department.

If you have trouble with or questions about your claim, you also may contact your state insurance department for help.

Your state insurance department has consumer services personnel who can help you work with your insurer to

resolve disagreements.

2022 NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF INSURANCE COMMISSIONERS 11A CONSUMER’S GUIDE TO HOME INSURANCE: LOSING YOUR INSURANCE

LOSING YOUR INSURANCE

There’s a big difference between an insurance company cancelling your policy and not renewing it.

Cancellation means either you or your insurance company stop the coverage before the policy’s normal expiration

date (which is usually 12 months after the policy starts). You can always cancel your policy for any reason. When

you’re a new policyholder, there’s a limited period of time (typically 60 days) in which your insurance company can

cancel your policy for any reason. After that, it can only cancel you if you don’t pay your premium, if you’ve lied on your

application or if your risk has changed substantially.

If your insurance company cancels your policy, it must give you notice. The number of days varies by state. If you or the

insurer cancels your policy, the company may refund a portion of your premium.

Non-renewal means the company refuses to renew your policy after it expires. Insurance companies generally have

the right to not renew your policy. If your company chooses not to renew your policy, it must give you notice; the number

of days (typically 30 days before the renewal date) varies by state. You may ask the insurer for the reason. You also may

choose not to renew your policy.

WHAT TO DO IF YOU CAN’T FIND INSURANCE

Contact your state insurance department to see if your state has a FAIR Plan, wind pool, or other residual market

mechanism information or market assistance program available. See below for information on contacting your

insurance department.

# Homeowners Basics

Homeowners insurance is a package policy. This means that it covers both damage to property and liability or legal responsibility for any injuries and property damage policyholders or their families cause to other people. This includes damage caused by household pets.

Damage caused by most disasters is covered but there are exceptions. Standard homeowners policies do not cover flooding, earthquakes or poor maintenance. Flood coverage is provided by the federal government’s National Flood Insurance Program, although it is purchased from an insurance agent. Earthquake coverage is available either in the form of an endorsement or as a separate policy. Most maintenance related problems are the homeowners’ responsibility.

A standard homeowners insurance policy includes four essential types of coverage. They include:

**1. Coverage for the structure of the home**

This part of a policy pays to repair or rebuild a home if it is damaged or destroyed by fire, hurricane, hail, lightning or other disaster listed in the policy. It will not pay for damage caused by a flood, earthquake or routine wear and tear. Most standard policies also cover structures that are not attached to a house such as a garage, tool shed or gazebo.

**2. Coverage for personal belongings**

Furniture, clothes, sports equipment and other personal items are covered if they are stolen or destroyed by fire, hurricane or other insured disaster. Most companies provide coverage for 50 to 70 percent of the amount of insurance on the structure of a home. This part of the policy includes off-premises coverage. This means that belongings are covered anywhere in the world, unless the policyholder has decided against off-premises coverage. Expensive items like jewelry, furs and silverware are covered, but there are usually dollar limits if they are stolen. To insure these items to their full value, individuals can purchase a special personal property endorsement or floater and insure the item for its appraised value.

Trees, plants and scrubs are also covered under standard homeowners insurance—generally up to about $500 per item. Perils covered are theft, fire, lightning, explosion, vandalism, riot and even falling aircraft. They are not covered for damage by wind or disease.

**3. Liability protection**Liability covers against lawsuits for bodily injury or property damage that policyholders or family members cause to other people. It also pays for damage caused by pets. The liability portion of the policy pays for both the cost of defending the policyholder in court and any court awards—up to the limit of the policy. Coverage is not just in the home but extends to anywhere in the world. Liability limits generally start at about $100,000. An umbrella or excess liability policy, which provides broader coverage, including claims for libel and slander, as well as higher liability limits, can be added to the policy.

**4. Additional living expenses**

This pays the additional costs of living away from home if a house is inhabitable due to damage from a fire, storm or other insured disaster. It covers hotel bills, restaurant meals and other living expenses incurred while the home is being rebuilt. Coverage for additional living expenses differs from company to company.

**Types of Homeowners Insurance Policies**The different types of homeowners policies are fairly standard throughout the country. However, individual states and companies may offer policies that are slightly different or go by other names such as “standard" or “deluxe." The one exception is the state of Texas, where policies vary somewhat from policies in other states. The Texas Insurance Department ([http://www.tdi.state.tx.us](http://www.tdi.state.tx.us/) ) has detailed information on its various homeowners policies.

People who own the home they live in have several policies to choose from. The most popular policy is the HO-3. It provides coverage for the structure of the home and personal belongings as well as personal liability coverage. It also provides the broadest coverage, protecting against 16 disasters or perils listed below.

- Fire or lightning
- Windstorm or hail
- Explosion
- Riot or civil commotion
- Damage caused by aircraft
- Damage caused by vehicles
- Smoke
- Vandalism or malicious mischief
- Theft
- Volcanic eruption
- Falling object
- Weight of ice, snow or sleet
- Accidental discharge or overflow of water or steam from within a plumbing, heating, air conditioning, or automatic fire-protective sprinkler system, or from a household appliance
- Sudden and accidental tearing apart, cracking, burning, or bulging of a steam or hot water heating system, an air conditioning or automatic fire-protective system
- Freezing of a plumbing, heating, air conditioning or automatic, fire-protective sprinkler system, or of a household appliance
- Sudden and accidental damage from artificially generated electrical current (does not include loss to a tube, transistor or similar electronic component)

Owners of multifamily homes generally purchase an HO-3 with an endorsement to cover the risks associated with having renters live in their houses. Other types of policies for home owners are the HO2, which provides more limited coverage, the HO-1, a bare bones policy that is not widely available, and the HO-8, designed for older homes. There is also a version of the HO-2 designed for mobile homes.

The HO4-policy was created specifically for those who rent the home they live in. It covers a policyholder’s belongings against all 16 perils. It also provides personal liability coverage for damage the policyholder or dependents may cause to third parties. The HO-6 policy was designed for owners of condominium and cooperative units. It provides coverage for belongings and the structural parts of the condominium or co-op that the policyholder owns. It protects against all 16 perils and provides personal liability coverage. Both cover additional living expenses.

**Levels of Coverage**

There are three coverage options:

**1. Actual Cash Value**

This policy pays to replace the home or possessions minus a deduction for depreciation.

**2. Replacement Cost**

This policy pays the cost of rebuilding or repairing the home or replacing possessions without a deduction for depreciation.

**3. Guaranteed/Extended Replacement Cost**This policy offers the highest level of protection. A guaranteed replacement cost policy pays whatever it costs to rebuild the home as it was before the fire or other disaster—even if it exceeds the policy limit. This gives protection against sudden increases in construction costs due to a shortage of building materials after a widespread disaster or other unexpected situations. It generally won’t cover the cost of upgrading the house to comply with current building codes. However, an endorsement (or an addition to) the policy called Ordinance or Law can help pay for these additional costs.

Some insurance companies offer an extended, rather than a guaranteed, replacement cost policy. An extended policy pays a certain percentage over the limit to rebuild the home. Generally, it is 20 to 25 percent more than the limit of the policy. For example, if homeowners take out a policy for $100,000, they can get up to an extra $20,000 or $25,000 of coverage. Guaranteed and extended replacement cost policies are more expensive; but they offer the best financial protection against disasters for a home. These coverages, however, may not be available in all states or from all companies. Replacement cost coverage is available for the structure of the home, but only actual cash value coverage is available for possessions.

# Coverage for the structure of your home

Your homeowners policy pays to repair or rebuild your home if it is damaged or destroyed by fire, hurricane, hail, lightning or other disasters listed in your policy. Most policies also cover detached structures such as a garage, tool shed or gazebo—generally for about 10 percent of the amount of insurance you have on the structure of the house.

A standard policy will *not* pay for damage caused by a flood, earthquake or routine wear and tear.

When purchasing coverage for the structure of your home, remember this simple guideline: Purchase enough coverage to rebuild your home.

# Coverage for your personal belongings

Your furniture, clothes, sports equipment and other personal items are covered if they are stolen or destroyed by fire, hurricane or other insured disasters. The coverage is generally 50 to 70 percent of the insurance you have on the structure of the house.

The best way to determine if this is enough coverage is to [conduct a home inventory](http://www.iii.org/article/how-create-home-inventory).

Personal belongings coverage includes items stored off-premises—this means you are covered anywhere in the world. Some companies limit the amount to 10 percent of the amount of insurance you have for your possessions. You also have up to $500 of coverage for unauthorized use of your credit cards.

Expensive items like jewelry, furs, art, collectibles and silverware are covered, but there are usually dollar limits if they are stolen. To insure these items to their full value, purchase a special [personal property endorsement or floater](https://www.iii.org/article/floaters-and-endorsements-special-coverage-valuables) and insure the item for its officially appraised value.

[Trees, plants and shrubs are also covered](http://www.iii.org/article/trees-and-insurance) under standard homeowners insurance—generally for about $500 per item. Trees and plants are not covered for disease, or if they have been poorly maintained.

# Liability protection

Liability covers you against lawsuits for bodily injury or property damage that you or family members cause to other people. It also pays for damage caused by your pets. So, if your son, daughter (or even your dog) accidentally ruins a neighbor’s expensive rug, you are covered. (However, if they destroy *your* rug, you’re out of luck.)

The liability portion of your policy pays for both the cost of defending you in court and any court awards—up to the limit stated in your policy documents.

Liability limits generally start at about $100,000, however, it’s a good idea to discuss whether you should purchase a higher level of protection with your insurance professional. If you have significant assets and want more coverage than is available under your homeowners policy, consider purchasing an [umbrella](http://www.iii.org/article/what-umbrella-liability) or excess liability policy, which provides broader coverage and higher liability limits.

Your policy also provides no-fault medical coverage, so if a friend or neighbor is injured in your home, he or she can simply submit medical bills to your insurance company. This way, expenses can be paid without a liability claim being filed against you. It does not, however, pay the medical bills for your own family or your pet.

# Additional living expenses (ALE)

ALE pays the additional costs of living away from home if you cannot live there due to damage from a an insured disaster. It covers hotel bills, restaurant meals and other costs, over and above your usual living expenses, incurred while your home is being rebuilt.

Keep in mind that the ALE coverage in your homeowners policy has limits—and some policies include a time limitation. However, these limits are *separate* from the amount available to rebuild or repair your home. Even if you use up your ALE your insurance company will still pay the full cost of rebuilding your home up to the policy limit.

If you rent out part of your house, ALE also covers you for the rent that you would have collected from your tenant if your home had not been destroyed.

Congratulations on beginning your journey to homeownership. Here’s why
prioritizing homeowners insurance coverage should be one of your first steps:
•
Lenders might not approve or release the funds for your
mortgage without proof of an insurance policy.
•
You could lose everything you own and pay out of pocket to
rebuild, repair or replace your home and belongings if a fire,
natural disaster, or other event were to strike your home.
•
If your home is burglarized, the costs to replace your
belongings can become a major challenge.
•
Anything you own could be used as leverage in a lawsuit,
including your home if someone gets injured on your property
and sues you.
Homeowners insurance can protect your investment and financial
future and help you manage costs should these incidents
happen. Therefore, it’s essential to talk with a trusted insurance
professional to understand your coverage needs and learn how
different types of homeowners policies may work for you.

What factors can impact the costs to rebuild my home after a disaster?
Age of home
The number of bathrooms
and other rooms
Special features such as fireplaces,
exterior trim or arched windows
The type of roof and
materials used
Whether the house—or a
part of it—was custom built
The type of exterior
wall construction—
frame, masonry (brick
or stone) or veneer
The style of the house, for
example, ranch or colonial
Improvements such as the
addition of second bathroom,
or a kitchen renovation
Other structures on
the premises such as
garages, sheds
How much insurance do I need for my home?
Standard homeowners policies provide coverage for disasters such as damage due to fire, lightning, hail and explosions. Homeowners
who live in areas where there is risk of flood or earthquake will need separate insurance coverage for those disasters, as well. In every
case, you’ll want the limits on your policy to be high enough to cover the cost of rebuilding your home in the event of a total loss.
The price you paid for your home—or the current market price—may be more or less than the cost to rebuild. And if the limit of your
insurance policy is based on your mortgage (as some banks require), it may not adequately cover the cost of rebuilding.
While your insurer will provide a recommended coverage limit for the structure of your home, it’s a good idea to educate yourself as well.
Use these three main guidelines to protect your home and your assets with adequate insurance coverage.

1. 
    1. Keep in mind the major factors that will impact home rebuilding costs.
    •
    Local construction costs
    •
    The square footage of the structure
    Make a quick estimate of the amount of insurance you need before shopping for a policy.
    •
    Multiply the total square footage of your home by local, per-square-foot building costs. (Note that the land is not factored into
    rebuilding estimates.)
    •
    To find out construction costs in your community, call your local real estate agent, builders association or insurance agent.
2. Gather information on the other crucial details that can impact home rebuilding costs.

Connect with your Insurance Professional
To better understand some essential insurance factors when shopping for a house, call your insurance professional. Avoid waiting until
the last minute to think about homeowners insurance so that you can ask plenty of questions and request estimates on more than one
house. Ask if the house will qualify for coverage, and get an estimate of the annual premium. The sooner you speak with your insurance
professional, the smoother the process will be. If you’re uncomfortable with the cost of insuring a particular house, look for one that better
fits your financial situation.
Always make sure your insurance professional and company are licensed to do business in your state. In addition, check the financial
health of prospective companies by researching their ratings and reviews.
Be sure to discuss the following to understand the implications on your homeowners insurance coverage needs::
Check the loss history report: Ask your insurance
professional to obtain and review the loss history report
on your prospective home with you. A loss history
report is a record of insurance claims associated with a
property. This helpful information is stored in a database
known as the Comprehensive Loss Underwriting
Exchange (C.L.U.E.). For instance, if there was a claim for
water damage on the home, it is important to find out the
source of the damage (such as a burst pipe) and whether
it has been properly repaired. On the other hand, a claim
for wind or hail that resulted in a new roof makes the
home stronger and is very attractive from an insurance
perspective.
Estimate maintenance costs: Routine maintenance is
your responsibility as a homeowner so be sure to factor
these costs into the overall price of owning the home.
Losses caused by failing to properly care for your home
are not covered by standard homeowners insurance
policies
Flood risk: Damage from flooding is NOT covered by
standard homeowners insurance. However, separate
flood insurance is available from the National Flood
Insurance Program (NFIP) and a few specialty insurers.
Consider flood coverage, regardless of whether your
home is in an area at high risk.
Get the house inspected: Accompany the inspector to
make sure he or she is thorough and makes sure to:
•
•
•
•
•
•
Check the general condition of the home.
Look for water damage, termites and other types of
infestation.
Review the electrical system, plumbing, septic tank
and water heater.
Show you where potential problems might develop.
Double-check that past problems have been
repaired.
Suggest important upgrades or replacements.
If the inspector raises questions, your insurance
company might, too. Be sure to find out if there is an
underground oil storage tank, as many insurers will not
provide policies for homes that have one.
History of earthquakes: While earthquakes are most
frequently associated with California, they can occur
nationwide and are not covered under standard
home insurance policies. Earthquake insurance is
available from private insurers as an endorsement to a
homeowners policy, and in California from the California
Earthquake Authority.
Wildfires: Wildfires can occur in at least 38 states,
especially California, where eight out of 10 of the most
costly fires have happened. To understand whether your
home could be at risk, look for conditions that could lead
to the start of fires, including drought, dry undergrowth,
and combustible materials. Also, look for elements in
the area that can encourage fires to spread, such as
the tight clustering of homes, combustible fences, and
attached decks.

What’s covered in a standard home policy?
Coverage for Structures and Dwelling
Homeowners insurance provides payments to repair or rebuild
your home if it is damaged or destroyed by fire, hurricane, hail,
lightning, or other disasters listed in your policy. Most policies
also cover detached structures such as a garage, tool shed
or gazebo—generally for about 10 percent of the amount of
insurance you have on the structure of the house. A standard
policy will not pay for damage caused by a flood, earthquake
or routine wear and tear. When purchasing coverage for
the structure of your home, remember this simple guideline:
Purchase enough coverage to rebuild your home in the event of
a total loss.
Personal Belongings
Your personal belongings, such as your furniture, clothes, sports
equipment, and other personal items are covered if they are
stolen or destroyed by fire, hurricane or other insured disasters.
The coverage is generally 50 to 70 percent of the insurance you
have on the structure of the house.
The best way to determine if this is enough coverage is to
conduct a home inventory.
Personal belongings coverage includes items stored off-
premises—this means you are covered anywhere in the world.
Some companies limit off-premises coverage to 10 percent of
the total amount of insurance you have for your possessions. You
also have up to $500 of coverage for unauthorized use of your
credit cards.
Expensive items like jewelry, furs, art, collectibles, and silverware
are covered, but there are usually dollar limits if they are stolen.
To insure these items to their full value, purchase a special
personal property endorsement or floater.
Landscaping
Trees, plants and shrubs are also covered under standard
homeowners insurance—generally for about $500 per item.
Trees and plants are not covered for disease, or if they have
been poorly maintained.
No-Fault Medical
Your policy also provides no-fault medical coverage, so if a friend
or neighbor is injured in your home, he or she can simply submit
medical bills to your insurance company. This way, expenses can
be paid without a liability claim being filed against you. It does
not, however, pay the medical bills for your own family or your
pet.
Liability Protection
Liability protection covers you against lawsuits for bodily injury
or property damage that you or family members cause to other
people. It also pays for damage caused by your pets. So, if your
son, daughter (or even your dog) accidentally ruins a neighbor’s
expensive rug, you are covered.
The liability portion of your policy pays for both the cost of
defending you in court and any court awards—up to the limit
stated in your policy documents.
Liability limits generally start at about $100,000. However, it’s
a good idea to discuss whether you should purchase a higher
level of protection with your insurance professional. If you have
significant assets and want more coverage than is available
under your homeowners policy, consider purchasing an umbrella
or excess liability policy, which provides broader coverage and
higher liability limits.
Additional Living Expenses
Additional living expenses (ALE) pays the additional costs of
living away from home if you cannot live there due to damage
from an insured disaster. It covers hotel bills, restaurant meals
and other costs, over and above your usual living expenses,
incurred while your home is being rebuilt or repaired.
Keep in mind that the ALE coverage in your homeowners policy
has limits—and some policies include a time or dollar limitation.
However, these limits are separate from the amount available to
rebuild or repair your home. Even if you use up your ALE your
insurance company will still pay the full cost of rebuilding your
home up to the policy limit.
If you rent out part of your house, ALE also covers you for the
rent that you would have collected from your tenant if your home
had not become uninhabitable because of a covered event.
[iii.org](http://iii.org/) | 4
Other factors to consider when evaluating your
homeowners insurance needs
Is your home up to code?
Building codes are updated periodically and may have changed
significantly since your home was built. In the event of damage,
you may be required to rebuild your home to the new codes and
homeowners insurance policies (even a guaranteed replacement
cost policy) generally won’t pay for that extra expense. If you
suspect that elements of your home are not up to current
building codes, consider getting an endorsement to your policy
called Ordinance or Law coverage, which pays a specified
amount toward bringing a house up to code during a covered
repair.
Determine how much insurance you need for your possessions
Most homeowners insurance policies provide coverage for your
belongings at about 50 to 70 percent of the insurance on your
dwelling. However, that standard amount may or may not be
enough. To find out how much coverage you may need for your
belongings, consider taking a a couple of simple steps.
If your home is older, will you need a policy to cover hard-to-
replace features?
If you own an older home, you may have to buy a modified
replacement cost policy. This means that instead of repairing
or replacing features typical of older homes, such as plaster
walls, with the same or closely similar materials, the policy will
pay for repairs using today’s standard building materials and
construction techniques.
Conduct a home inventory of your personal possessions
In order to accurately assess the value of what you own, conduct
a home inventory. Documenting a detailed list of your belongings
will not only help you figure out how much insurance you need,
but it will also serve as a convenient record if you have a claim.
Most insurers have apps to ease the process.
There are several apps available to help you take a home
inventory, and our article on how to create a home inventory can
help, as well.
While you’re reviewing your possessions, think about whether
you want to insure them for actual cash value (where the
policy would pay less money for older items than you paid
for them new) or for replacement cost (which would cover to
replace the items). The price of replacement cost coverage
for homeowners is about 10 percent more but is generally a
worthwhile investment in the long run. (Note that flood insurance
for belongings is only available on an actual cash value basis.)
If costs rise for building materials, will your replacement
coverage be enough?
Inflation can impact rebuilding costs. If you plan on owning your
home for a while, consider adding an inflation guard clause to
your policy. An inflation guard automatically adjusts the dwelling
limit to reflect current construction costs in your area when you
renew your insurance policy each year.
After a major catastrophe such as a hurricane, tornado, or
wildfire construction costs may rise suddenly because the price
of building materials and shortage of construction workers
increase due to the widespread demand. This price bump may
push rebuilding costs above your homeowners policy limits..
To protect against this possibility, an extended replacement
cost coverage endorsement can pay an extra 10 to 50 percent
above the limits (available through most insurance companies). A
guaranteed replacement cost policy will pay whatever it costs to
rebuild your home as it was before the disaster and is available
through a limited number of insurance companies.
Create a tally of your expensive items
There are limits on how much a standard homeowners insurance
policy will cover for items such as jewelry, silverware, collectibles,
and furs. For example, jewelry coverage may be limited to under
$2,000. Some insurance companies may also place a limit on
what they will pay for computers.
Check your policy (or ask your insurance professional) for the
limits of your coverage for any expensive items. If your home
inventory includes items for which the limits are too low, consider
buying a special personal property floater or an endorsement.
This will allow you to insure valuables individually or as a
collection, with significantly higher coverage limits.

Determine how much coverage for additional living expense
insurance you may need
If you can’t live in your home due to a fire, severe storm or other
insured disaster, coverage for Additional Living Expenses (ALE)
pays the costs of temporarily living elsewhere, including hotel
bills, restaurant meals and other living expenses incurred while
your home is being rebuilt.
If you rent out part of your house, this coverage also reimburses
you for the rent that you would have collected from your tenant
if your home had not become unhabitable because of a covered
event.
Many policies provide ALE coverage equal to about 20 percent
of the insurance on your house’s dwelling. However, ALE
coverage limits vary from company to company, with some
policies providing unlimited coverage for a limited amount of
time. In contrast, others may only set limits on the amount of
coverage.
Determine how much liability insurance you need
The liability portion of homeowners insurance covers you against
lawsuits for bodily injury or property damage that you or family
members or pets cause to other people, as well as court costs
incurred and damages awarded.
Most homeowners insurance policies provide a minimum of
$100,000 worth of liability insurance, but higher amounts are
available and, increasingly, it is recommended that homeowners
consider purchasing at least $300,000 to $500,000 worth of
liability coverage.
Consider an umbrella or excess liability policy
Umbrella or excess liability policies provide coverage over and
above your standard home (or auto) liability policy limits. These
policies start to pay after you have used up the liability insurance
in your underlying policy. In addition to providing additional
dollar amount coverage, umbrella or excess liability often offers
broader coverage than standard policies.
Do you have property, investments, or savings worth more
than the liability limits of your homeowners policy? A separate
excess liability or umbrella policy might protect these assets.
For example, your homeowners insurance may help with repair
costs for swimming pools damaged by disasters. In contrast, an
umbrella policy can help with legal expenses that could arise if
friends or neighbors get injured in your pool.
The cost of an umbrella policy depends on how much underlying
insurance you have and the kind of risk you represent. The
greater the underlying liability coverage you have, the cheaper
the umbrella or excess policy. Most companies will require a
minimum of $300,000 underlying liability insurance on your
standard homeowners policy for umbrella coverage.

Six Ways to Get the Right Amount of Homeowners Insurance
Raise your deductible in exchange for lower premiums.
A policy deductible is the amount you are responsible for
paying towards a covered expense before the insurer will pay
on a claim. The higher your deductible, the more money you
can save on your insurance premium. However, your insurance
policy may have a separate deductible for major disasters such
as earthquakes, hurricanes, or wind/hail storms if you live in a
disaster-prone area. Consider that when deciding whether to
raise the standard homeowners deductible.
Ask about discounts and bundle options.
Most insurers provide discounts for home modernization
improvements and security devices such as smoke detectors,
burglar and fire alarm systems, or deadbolt locks. These
measures can be costly and may not produce a discount
for every policy, so talk to your insurance professional for
recommendations before spending money.
Many insurers that sell homeowners policies also sell auto and
umbrella liability policies and may offer premium discounts
for bundling (purchasing multiple insurance products). Check
whether any combined price from one insurer is lower than
buying the coverages separately from different companies.
Review your insurance coverage annually.
Track the updates and changes made to your home and maintain
an inventory of your belongings. Discuss this information
with your insurance professional to ensure your coverage is
adequate and you are not paying for coverage you no longer
need.
Be aware that homeowners policy prices can vary by hundreds
of dollars from company to company. Getting at least three
insurance estimates when shopping around is a good idea.
Making policy comparisons and potentially a few suggested
home modifications and improvements can save money while
adequately protecting your home and assets.
Make your home more disaster resilient.
Is your home in a disaster-prone area? In that case, you may still
be able to widen your insurance options by taking preparedness
steps, such as installing storm shutters and shatterproof glass
to resist hurricane damage or reinforcing the foundation
to withstand earthquakes better. Use fire-resistant building
materials and defensible space (a buffer between your home
and the surrounding area) if you live in areas prone to wildfire
risk. Consider modernizing heating, plumbing, and electrical
systems to reduce the risk of fire and water damage. Discuss
with your insurance professional how these precautions may
lower premiums and help to prevent excessive damage and
rebuilding costs.
Keep in mind value includes service, so do your research.
Don’t shop by price alone. If you need to file a claim, the last
thing you’ll want is a company that cuts corners on service.
Instead, you’ll want a company that provides a high-quality
customer experience.
Talk to your relatives, friends, and trusted colleagues about their
policies. Look at the information on consumer complaint ratios
maintained by your state insurance department or the National
Association of Insurance Commissioners. Remember that the
attention you receive during the shopping phase can indicate
how a company will respond when you need to file a claim.
Don’t confuse the total amount you paid for your house with
the rebuilding costs.
A house–but not the land underneath it–can be at risk from
windstorms, fire, theft, and other perils and need repairs. To
avoid paying a higher than necessary premium, focus on
potential rebuilding costs for the structure of your home instead
of the total real estate value, which includes the price of the land.

FAQs
What if insurance coverage is hard to find?
If you are not able to find affordable coverage for your home,
you can explore options with excess and surplus lines carriers
or with the Fair Access to Insurance Requirements (FAIR) plans
that are available in most states. These markets exist to offer
coverage for risks that traditional carriers may not be willing or
able to write.
Why is it important to call your agent annually and check your
coverage if I’ve recently renovated?
The cost to repair your home or replace your possessions
usually increases each year as prices rise. This has been
especially true in 2021-2023 as inflation drove the prices of
construction materials and labor upward at a far higher rate than
long-term averages. Reviewing your coverage annually with your
insurance professional is the best way to ensure you are insured
properly for any future claims.
Why are insurance rates rising?
Several factors can lead to more frequent claims and higher
claims costs, ultimately driving insurance rates up:
•
Rising property values.
•
Frequent disasters (wildfires, storms, etc.) that lead to severe
damage and loss.
•
Regional price surges for labor and materials due to
increased demand after these events.
•
Continued construction and increased migration in areas
prone to these disaster risks.
•
Labor and supply chain shocks, such as the pandemic and
the invasion of Ukraine.
However, as risks and costs grow, the insurance industry is
intensifying its focus on predicting and preventing future damage
and losses. Homeowners can do their part by being aware of the
risks specific to their property and region and taking preventive
measures. Keeping an open dialogue with your insurance
professional can enhance your efforts to protect your investment
cost-effectively.
Key Definitions of Basic Homeowners Insurance Coverage
Actual Cash Value: Sometimes referred to as depreciated cash
value, this policy can provide a payout needed to fix or replace
your home and belongings minus the value of your property
because of age or use. Therefore, the amount you receive for
a covered claim can be significantly less than the total cost of
repairing damages to your home or replacing your belongings
with new ones at current prices.
Replacement Value/Cost: This coverage can defray costs to
repair or replace your property without a reduction in payout
for depreciation. If your home is damaged, replacement cost
coverage can pay to restore it using materials of similar quality.
Replacement cost coverage for your personal belongings can
help cover the cost of buying a new item at today’s price.
Extended Replacement Cost: Also known as extended dwelling
coverage or increased replacement cost, this coverage is an
add-on policy option that expands your dwelling coverage by
10 percent to 50 percent of the cost of rebuilding your home.
Homeowners in disaster-prone areas may find it especially
beneficial to have this extra protection, as prices for construction
materials and labor can rise significantly after a disaster.
Guaranteed Replacement Cost: This coverage pays out any cost
needed to rebuild your home in the event of a total loss, even
if the bill exceeds the limits of your policy. Be aware that while
many homeowners find this coverage to be the gold standard,
not all insurers offer it.

# Clue Report

A Loss History Report is a record of insurance losses associated with a home or a car. Most homeowners and auto insurance companies contribute claims history information to a database known as the Comprehensive Loss Underwriting Exchange (C.L.U.E.), which is available from LexisNexis. The information is generally used by insurers when they underwrite policies.
If you are buying a home it is a good idea to ask the current homeowner to request a copy of the C.L.U.E. loss history report. These reports provide a record of the type of loss on the home, the date of the loss and the amount and status of each claim—going back five years. By law, one free report is allowed per year. For homes an A-PLUSTM property report is also available from ISO®. If the report indicates there has been damage to the house, you can have it checked by a professional before committing to the purchase of the home.

As you strive to find the best rates for your homeowners and auto coverage, you might think shopping around is the way to manage affordability. However, costs are increasing for everything–groceries, gasoline, and other household expenses–and so are costs for insurers that impact your premiums. Before changing your policy or carrier, consider some factors that can affect your rates and learn how an annual insurance checkup can position you to get the coverage right for you.

# When shopping for the best insurance rates, here are some questions you might have:

### **I haven’t filed a claim or received any tickets, so why are my insurance rates going up?**

Premiums can rise because of more frequent claims and higher claims costs. Even if you have yet to personally experience a claim or insurable event, nationwide and regional trends can impact costs. For example, rising property values and more frequent disasters can cause rates for homeowners to climb. Increasing frequency and severity of accidents, thefts, damage, and other risks can influence auto rates. Price surges caused by labor and supply chain shocks can inflate property repair and replacement costs, affecting homeowners and auto premiums.

However, as risks and costs grow, the industry is intensifying its focus on predicting and preventing future damage and losses. Policyholders can do their part by being aware of the risks specific to their property and region and taking preventive measures when possible. Keeping an open dialogue with your insurance professional can further enhance your efforts to protect your investment cost-effectively.

### **What is the simplest way to save money on insurance premiums?**

Ask your current provider for a discount. There are two reasons for this strategy. Many companies value long-time customer relationships. Starting a new conversation with your insurer can help you tap into more affordable options. You might receive discounts for combining auto and home or renters with the same carrier. You can also receive discounts for paying in full or using autopay. Additionally, if you need to adjust your coverage due to changes in your household, lifestyle, or property, you may be eligible for discounts or other policy options from your current insurer.

### **Will switching my insurance carrier save me money on premiums?**

The answer depends on a number of factors specific to your coverage needs and the coverage you choose. Some policyholders switch companies for lower premiums only to discover the value they receive isn’t on par with what they need, negating their savings. (Remember, value goes beyond the price of policy to include customer service and the financial strength and stability of the insurer.) Others save money in the short-term but later face higher premiums, as early as the following year.

### **How does my credit history impact my insurance rates?**

Your credit history is only one of many factors that determine individual premiums. However, most home and car insurers view the way you manage your finances as an important clue as to how big of a risk you might be to cover. The weight of your credit history can vary among insurers, and many will develop their own [credit-based insurance score](https://www.iii.org/article/background-on-credit-scoring) for you. However, in general, maintaining excellent credit history can unlock lower rates for homeowners and auto coverage, whereas having a problematic credit history can be met with higher rate offers or reduced coverage options.

### **What is telematics and how can it lower my car insurance premiums?**

Telematics refers to the technology insurers can use to fine tune your risk profile and tailor car rates based on your driving habits. Policies involving [telematics](https://www.iii.org/article/background-on-pay-as-you-drive-auto-insurance-telematics) are also referred to as usage-based insurance (UBI) because it captures and evaluates how you use your car. The factors tracked can vary, but can include driving habits, mileage, weather and road conditions, and even when you drive.

Participating in a telematics program is voluntary, and whether these might be a suitable option for lowering your premiums depends on your driving and which driver behavior your insurer monitors. Be sure you understand the program. You’ll also want to be familiar with the amount of privacy you may be asked to exchange for (potentially) lower premiums.

### **How can I get the most value from my homeowners and auto coverage?**

The solution begins with understanding how your coverage can work to serve your financial goals. Insurance can be an integral part of your budget as you strive to protect your assets, but you might be considering how to manage affordability. Here is a list of tips to guide you in performing your annual insurance checkup.

# Roofs and your insurance

Your roof is an important part of the structure of your home or business. If it is well maintained, it protects the structure
from the perils of hail, wind, water (rain, ice), fire, and other hazards. An old or poorly maintained roof can increase
the risk of interior damage to ceilings, walls, foundations, and contents, such as furniture. Even a small leak can cause
widespread water damage and can cause mold and mildew. Another concern is lightning. A lightning strike can cause
a power surge that can impact electrical systems throughout a house or business. In homes, it can mean loss of
appliances, electronics and more. In business, it can mean the loss of computers, communication devices and security
systems, resulting in data loss and business interruption, according to the Lightning Protection Institute (LPI). A lightning
bolt generates intense heat, capable of igniting roof trusses and insulation, which increases the likelihood of fires. The
shockwave produced by a lightning strike can damage your roof – dislodging shingles, loosening gutters and damaging
chimney bricks. That’s why it’s important to take precautionary measures by properly installing a lightning protection
system, which consists of a roof lightning rod that conducts the energy from a lightning strike over the broader area of the
roof reducing the amount of heat transferred to the building and reducing the potential of damage due to fire.
One of the biggest factors that play a role in how your insurance company will pay for roof replacement is its age and
condition. If your roof is over 20 years old when you apply for home or business insurance, most insurance companies
will require it to pass an inspection. Other insurers may decline to write new policies for homes or businesses with older
roofs. And if they do accept your application, they may specify that it’s only covered at its actual cash value (ACV) —
meaning depreciation is factored into your final payout - rather than Replacement Cost Value (RCV).
Why is insurance underwriting and pricing changing?
In the past 20 years, the average cost of claims per insured home in the United States has increased at a rate that has
outpaced inflation. This trend is being driven by a combination of factors, including natural catastrophes, rising home
repair costs, supply chain disruptions, and the ongoing migration of populations into areas susceptible to disasters,
according to the Insurance Research Council. Additionally, insurance companies face challenges related to fraud,
excessive claims, and legal system abuse in the aftermath of catastrophic events. These cost drivers have led to less
affordable homeowners insurance countrywide. Some areas are experiencing both affordability and availability crises,
as some insurers respond to these challenges by reducing coverage or withdrawing from specific markets entirely. Wind
and hailstorms have been increasing over the past several years, impacting millions of homes and businesses. Roofs
are also highly vulnerable to wildfire due to their large surface area and the potential for embers to land on. For roofs
that are not maintained, debris can easily be ignited and in the worst case accumulate enough to ignite the roof itself.
Understanding how many vulnerable roofs exist in wildfire-prone areas can illuminate the scale and cost of home and
business retrofits needed to help communities adapt to wildfires.

When you renew your policy, check to see if there are changes to your roof coverage. As roofs age, some companies
are automatically switching to ACV. Find out if your insurance company offers an endorsement or additional roof
coverages. Some companies offer a better roof replacement endorsement, for example, and will pay to replace your
roof with stronger and safer materials if it’s damaged by a covered peril. Some offer customers the option to select full
replacement cost but at a higher rate. If the roof is in poor condition, your insurance company may not renew coverage
for your home or business. Insurers will typically offer you a time frame to replace the roof before canceling the coverage.
Purchasing a home or business with an old roof can be challenging because it can be difficult to get insurance, and the
coverage may be limited. Some insurance companies may deny coverage or require a roof inspection before they issue
a policy. If insurance does cover an older roof, it may only cover the original cost of the roof, not the current replacement
cost. Roof repair or replacement may be necessary: Repairing or replacing a roof can help secure more favorable
coverage rates.
Increased Roofing Fraud
Roofing fraud perpetuated on unsuspecting homeowners and business owners is another factor that has resulted in
higher premiums and changes in insurance policies. States like Florida have been particularly hard hit by roofing fraud.
The National Insurance Crime Bureau (NICB) estimates that Americans lose billions of dollars each year to contractor
fraud, including roofing fraud. Some common roofing scams include:
Unforeseen costs: Contractors may claim that there is unexpected damage or increased material costs once the job
has started and demand more money.
Temporary repairs: Contractors may encourage you to spend a lot of money on temporary repairs, which may leave
you without enough money for permanent repairs.
Exaggerated damage: Contractors may lie about the extent of the damage (or even create the damage) to overbill
you or your insurance company.

•
Lowball bids: Contractors may try to entice you with a low bid that does not match the actual scope of your roof repair
or replacement.
•
Shoddy repairs: Contractors may rush the work and use substandard materials.
•
Some fraudulent contractors go from house to house after a storm, promising to get your insurer to pay for a new roof,
when there’s only been minimal damage.
•
Remember, despite contractor claims, your insurance company is not obligated to pay for a new roof solely because
your current roof is old or worn out.
•
If you suspect roofing fraud you can report it anonymously by calling toll-free 800.TEL.NICB (800.835.6422)
or submitting a form on NICB’s website.
Many states have roofing legislation, including laws that regulate roofing contractors and insurance claims:
•
Roofing contractor licensing
Some states require a license to perform roofing work, while others don’t. For example, Alaska requires a license
for roofing as a specialty trade, while Arkansas doesn’t have any roofer-specific licenses. New York State requires
roofing contractors to have a written contract with the owner that includes insurance information. As a homeowner
or business owner, it’s important to know what the license requirements are in your state. Here is a list of license
requirements in all 50 states from FIXR.
•
Insurance claims
Some states have laws that impact how roofing insurance claims are handled. For example, Florida’s SB 76 of 2021
shortened the claim filing period from three to two years and requires homeowners to provide detailed damage
estimates.
•
Other roofing legislation
Some states have other roofing-related laws, such as advertising restrictions or building code requirements. In June
2021, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis signed a bill restricting how contractors can advertise and what they can say
to homeowners. Before May 26, 2022, the rule in Florida was that, if more than 25% of a roof needed to be repaired
or replaced, then the entire roof system was required to be replaced to bring the entire roof up to code (the “25%
Roof Replacement Rule”). However, when SB 4-D took effect that day, it eliminated Florida’s 25% Roof Replacement
Rule. Now, so long as the rest of the roof is in compliance with the 2007 Florida Building Code, or any subsequent
versions of that code, then a full roof replacement is not required. The homeowner is only required to have the part of
their roof repaired or replaced brought up to the current version of the Florida Building Code. This legislation aims to
ease the financial burden on insurers, many of whom suffered significant losses due to fraudulent or unnecessary roof
replacement claims post-hurricane season.

Roof shape and material are important when determining premiums
The shape of a roof can affect insurance premiums because some shapes are more durable than others. There are two
primary types of roofs:
Low-slope Roofs have a very low pitch (less than 9.5°, or 2:12 or less). Common in industrial buildings, but also some
homes. Low slope roofs can be very durable and if maintained, works well for water removal. Most common examples
are Steep Slope Roofs, which have a pitch greater than or equal to 14°, or 3:12. Most common configurations are hip and
gable or a combination of both. Hip configurations are more wind resistant than a gable roof. Roof pitch is a crucial aspect
and can protect your home or business from the elements. Water is one of the larger threats to a roof, as it can seep into
the roofing and cause water damage. Pooling water is more likely to get inside your roofing, and steeper pitches make
it harder for water to pool. Steeper pitches can more easily carry water down and into your gutters. Steeper roof pitches
can shed snow and ice more quickly after a snowstorm and will help prevent build-up. Roof pitch is so important that
many areas that have large amounts of snow will have a minimum roof pitch requirement in their municipal code.
Selecting the right roofing material is vital to its durability. Roofing material classifications for fire, wind and impact-
resistance are also important factors that insurance companies consider when calculating premiums. Traditional options
like asphalt shingles, metal, and tile each have their strengths. Asphalt shingles are cost-effective and easy to install,
however, homes built with durable alternatives such as metal, tile or synthetic materials can offer improved protection. A
slate roof, for example, is considered more stable and may earn you a lower insurance rate. A wood shake shingle isn’t
fire-resistant and poses a huge risk, particularly in wildfire-prone areas of the country, resulting in a higher rate or making
you ineligible for a policy. Tiles have longevity; however, they are susceptible to cracking once hail sizes exceed 2.25
inches.
Insurance Information Institute
How Your Roof Influences Your Home and Business Insurance | 5
Roof performance is based on where the home is located and the perils that impact it. For example, an asphalt shingle
roof even after 8-10 years becomes very vulnerable to severe winds from hurricanes or severe thunderstorms. A standing
seam metal roof is one of the most resilient roofs to severe weather such as hurricanes and thunderstorms. But proper
installation is crucial to its life expectancy. A good product installed incorrectly will not perform as the manufacturer has
intended.
The structural integrity of your roof is also crucial in withstanding adverse weather conditions. Ensure your roof’s framing
and support structures are designed to handle the local climate, including heavy snow loads, strong winds, or frequent
rain. Consulting with a structural engineer can help you assess and reinforce your roof’s strength.
Proper ventilation is often overlooked but plays a critical role in maintaining a resilient roof. Adequate ventilation helps
regulate temperature and moisture levels in an attic, preventing issues like mold growth and ice dams. It is important
to install vents strategically to ensure continuous airflow. Homes built under modern building codes (after 2000-2002),
shouldn’t be as much of a concern as those built from the 1960s to mid 1990s.
Just how long does your roof last?
Asphalt Roof
10-25 yrs
Clay and
Concrete Tiles
50+ yrs
Slate Tiles
50-150+ yrs
Metal Roof
50+ yrs
Wood Roof
30-50 yrs
One way to understand the vulnerability of roofs is to look at the damage caused when they fail. In most years, roof-
related damage is responsible for an estimated 70–90 percent of total insured residential catastrophic losses, depending
on specific weather events, according to the Insurance Institute for Business & Home Safety (IBHS).
IBHS’s FORTIFIED program – available in 27 states – is a voluntary construction and re-roofing method designed to
strengthen homes and commercial buildings against specific types of severe weather such as high winds, hail, hurricanes
and even tornadoes. The construction standard was created by IBHS after decades of research. In most areas, the
FORTIFIED Roof standard is a beyond-code re-roofing method shown in lab and field tests to help prevent damage from
high winds, hurricanes, hail, severe thunderstorms, and tornadoes up to EF-2. In some states, insurers offer discounts for
homes built or re-roofed to the FORTIFIED standard. In Alabama, for example, savings range from 20-55% off the wind
portion of the property owner’s insurance and is available for coastal and inland homeowners. Additionally, Alabama
Insurance Information Institute
How Your Roof Influences Your Home and Business Insurance | 6
provides commercial property owners statewide a discount on insurance rates for buildings using the FORTIFIED
Commercial standard.
Choosing a resilient roof involves a combination of the right materials, strong structure, effective sealing, proper
ventilation, and thoughtful design.
What are Deductibles?
A deductible is an amount you must pay before your company pays for your claim. Ask your insurance professional if the
deductible for wind and hail damage is different than the deductible for other types of damages. If it is, you might pay
more out-of-pocket if your roof is damaged in a storm.
Filing a claim
Types of roof damage covered by the insurer depend on the policy’s terms and the reasons the roof needs to be
repaired or replaced. A policy typically covers problems that are sudden or accidental and caused by certain events such
as falling objects, fire, hail, lightning, smoke, weight of ice and snow, wind, and vandalism.
To file a claim, contact your home insurance company or insurance agent professional. Provide information such as when
the damage occurred. Take photos or video of the damage if you can do so safely.
Why do insurers use aerial imagery to inspect houses and businesses?
Aerial technology can help insurers and regulators in a variety of ways including property assessment. Insurers have
been using aerial technology, including drones, satellites, and high-altitude balloons to take photos of properties without
needing to make in-person visits. This can save time and resources. For many years insurers have been using aerial
technology in disaster recovery to quickly assess damage after severe weather events and wildfires, which expedites the
claim process.
Insurance Information Institute
How Your Roof Influences Your Home and Business Insurance | 7
Aerial technology is highly sophisticated and captures much more precise data about the condition of a home or
business than an in-person inspection. Aerial imagery can also help insurers validate property information, damage
and claims. For example, aerial photos can show before and after images of a wildfire area that would otherwise be
inaccessible to adjusters. Aerial imagery can help insurers identify each property’s unique risk factors, which can improve
underwriting.
New technologies offered by drones, manned aircraft, or even satellites make home and business roof inspections
easier, safer, faster, and less costly. In addition, the data enables insurers to make more precise underwriting decisions on
the properties they insure. This can include damaged roof shingles, yard debris, overhanging tree branches, swimming
pools, or trampolines that have not been discussed during the process of applying for coverage. In most cases,
homeowners have an opportunity to remedy the situation so that they can get the coverage they need.
Roof Maintenance and Repair
A roof repair or replacement can be one of the largest expenses any homeowner might face, and no one can predict
when and if a severe weather event, fallen tree, or other factors will cause damage.
While home insurance coverage is dependent on cause of damage, homeowners are responsible for roof maintenance
and replacement due to normal wear and tear. That’s why it’s important to understand how warranties differ with different
roofing materials, how to increase your roof’s lifespan, and when a repair or replacement is necessary.
The Confusion About Shingle Warranties
Shingles may come with a product warranty of 25, 30, or even 50 years, so it’s easy to believe that your roof will last that
long. After all, that’s what the warranty promises—but not necessarily.
Those warranties only cover “manufacturer’s defect” and don’t guarantee the full lifespan. The warranty time span is not
an indicator for performance in severe weather and you shouldn’t expect that to be correlated. Shingle warranties can
also be pro-rated after the first few years, meaning they cover an increasingly smaller percentage as time progresses.
Even if a roof repair is necessary due to defective shingles, a roofer’s fees and labor make up the bulk of the expenses,
and the homeowner is responsible for them.
Always use approved roofing materials and components that meet the manufacturer’s specifications. Using non-
approved materials can compromise the warranty’s coverage. Seek prior approval from the manufacturer before making
any repairs or alterations to your roof. Unauthorized modifications can also void the warranty.

Tips on Roof Maintenance
Your insurance company will inspect your roof when you apply for insurance. They may charge you more or refuse to
insure you based on what they see. Early detection of roof damage is crucial for preventing further deterioration and
minimizing repair costs. Use this checklist to keep your roof in good shape, making it more likely to be insurable:
•
•
•
•
•
•
Have your roof inspected yearly, especially if it’s 15+
years old.
Regularly check your roof for debris and standing
water.
Trim tree branches to 6 ft away from any structure on
your property.
Remove dead branches and trees near your home,
garage, and other structures to prevent damage.
Keep an eye out for trouble signs such as cracks in
tree trunks and limbs or significant leaning and low
hanging branches.
No matter how precarious the tree is, your
homeowners insurance policy probably doesn’t
cover its preventative removal. The costs associated
with removing leaning, rotten, or otherwise
dangerous trees fall to the homeowner or business
owner. Damage caused by fallen trees that were not
removed due to property owner negligence may not
be covered by a homeowner’s or business owner’s
policy, and the owner could be held responsible for
any damages, injuries, and legal costs incurred.

Ways to Save Money on Repairs
While repairing or replacing a roof can be costly, it’s important to address problems as quickly as possible because what
starts as a minor issue, if ignored, will only get worse. Whether to repair or replace a roof depends on the condition of the
roof and the extent of the damage. But there are ways to save money.
Roof Grant Programs
There are many roof grant programs throughout the U.S. to help homeowners repair their roofs. The United States
Department of Agriculture (USDA), for example, offers the Rural Repair and Rehabilitation Grant program to assist rural
homeowners with essential home repairs, including roof replacements. To qualify, you must be in a rural area and have a
modest income.
In Florida there are over 211 approved Florida home improvement grants, grants for home repairs and repair assistance
resources available for homeowners (most, but not all, programs are based on income). The My Safe Florida Home
(MSFH) matching grant program is a state-funded program that reimburses Florida homeowners up to $10,000 to
make improvements to their homes to help lower their insurance rates. The state contributes $2 for every $1 spent by
homeowners, up to a maximum of a $10,000 grant. It prioritizes grants for low-income families and senior citizens.
In California there are several home improvement roof grant programs, home repair programs, weather assistance
programs, and federal tax credits, where homeowners can receive up to 30% of the price of many home energy
upgrades. California is also participating in a pilot program with grants available up to $10,000 (up from $7,500) and loans
available up to $40,000 (up from $20,000) with a maximum of $50,000 (up from $27,500) for assistance.
Alabama and Mississippi have several roof grant programs, including the Strengthen Alabama Homes, which provides up
to $10,000 to re-roof a home to the FORTIFIED Roof standard. The Mississippi Home Mitigation Program offers grants to
help residents shore up their homes, including roof upgrades.
Many insurance companies also offer wind mitigation discounts for homeowners and business owners who have impact-
resistant roofing typically in the range of 5% to 35%.
It’s simple: insurers are invested in resilient roofs. Why? Because the intensity of natural disasters and extreme weather
events are rising. Private insurers are responding with a host of strategies aimed at better understanding the risks of
these events, to promote resilience and close the protection gap. The insurance industry is evolving from a focus on
“detect and repair” to “predict and prevent.” This includes improved land-use and building codes, use of sophisticated
data and analytical tools to inform underwriting, reserving, and pricing, public- and private-sector collaboration to
address the decades-long trend of populations moving into harm’s way, which drives up the cost of extreme events; and
educating the public about advanced mitigation and the role of insurance as part of their resilience planning.
Resilient roofs help mitigate the impact of extreme weather and the cost of claims. For homeowners, it means protecting
their most important investment. For business owners, a resilient roof means reducing business disruption and revenue
loss. When an essential structure, like a hospital, school, or power facility, has a resilient roof, it can continue providing
critical services and support to those who rely on its purpose. If the roof does sustain limited damage, repairs are less
extensive, and downtime is reduced. More resilient roofs contribute to more resilient communities. 

# How much insurance do I need

if disaster strikes, you'll want enough homeowners insurance to rebuild the structure of your home, to help replace your belongings, to defray costs if you're unable to live in your home and to protect your financial assets in the event of liability to others. Use these guidelines to help determine the coverage and amounts you need.

---

# Determine how much insurance you need for your home's structure

[Standard homeowners policies](http://www.iii.org/article/what-covered-standard-homeowners-policy) provide coverage for disasters such as damage due to fire, lightning, hail and explosions. Those who live in areas where there is risk of [flood](http://www.iii.org/article/does-my-homeowners-insurance-cover-flooding) or [earthquake](http://www.iii.org/article/does-my-homeowners-insurance-cover-earthquake-damage) will need coverage for those disasters, as well. In every case, you'll want the limits on your policy to be high enough to cover the cost of rebuilding your home.

The price you paid for your home—or the current market price—may be more or less than the cost to rebuild. And if the limit of your insurance policy is based on your mortgage (as some banks require), it may not adequately cover the cost of rebuilding.

While your insurer will provide a recommended coverage limit for the structure of your home, it’s a good idea to educate yourself as well. To make sure your home has the right amount of structural coverage, consider:

### **Major factors that will impact home rebuilding costs**

- Local construction costs
- The square footage of the structure

For a quick estimate of the amount of insurance you need, multiply the total square footage of your home by local, per-square-foot building costs. (Note that the land is not factored into rebuilding estimates.) To find out construction costs in your community, call your local real estate agent, builders association or insurance agent.

### **Details that can impact home rebuilding costs**

- The type of exterior wall construction—frame, masonry (brick or stone) or veneer
- The style of the house, for example, ranch or colonial
- The number of bathrooms and other rooms
- The type of roof and materials used
- Other structures on the premises such as garages, sheds
- Special features such as fireplaces, exterior trim or arched windows
- Whether the house—or a part of it—was custom built
- Improvements you've made that have added value to your home, such as the addition of second bathroom, or a kitchen renovation

# Other considerations

### **Is your home up to code?**

Building codes are updated periodically and may have changed significantly since your home was built. In the event of damage, you may be required to rebuild your home to the new codes and homeowners insurance policies (even a guaranteed replacement cost policy—see below) generally won't pay for that extra expense. If you suspect that elements of your home are not up to current building codes, consider getting an endorsement to your policy called an Ordinance or Law, which pays a specified amount toward bringing a house up to code during a covered repair.

### **If your home is older, will you need a policy to cover hard-to-replace features?**

If you own an older home, you may have to buy a modified replacement cost policy. This means that instead of repairing or replacing features typical of older homes, such as plaster walls, with the same or closely similar materials, the policy will pay for repairs using today's standard building materials and construction techniques.

### **If costs rise for building materials, will your replacement coverage be enough?**

Inflation can impact rebuilding costs. If you plan on owning your home for a while, consider adding an inflation guard clause to your policy. An inflation guard automatically adjusts the dwelling limit to reflect current construction costs in your area when you renew your insurance.

After a major catastrophe such as a hurricane, tornado, or wildfire construction costs may rise suddenly because the price of building materials and shortage of construction workers increase due to the widespread demand. This price bump may push rebuilding costs above your homeowners policy limits and leave you short. To protect against this possibility, extended replacement cost coverage endorsement can pay an extra 5 to 25 percent above the limits (available through most insurance companies). A guaranteed replacement cost policy will pay whatever it costs to rebuild your home as it was before the disaster and is available through a limited number of insurance companies.

# Determine how much insurance you need for your possessions

Most homeowners insurance policies provide coverage for your belongings at about 50 to 70 percent of the insurance on your dwelling. However, that standard amount may or may not be enough. To find out how much coverage you may need for your belongings, consider taking a few simple steps

### **Conduct a home inventory of your personal possessions**

In order to accurately assess the value of what you own, it's highly advisable to conduct a home inventory. A detailed list of your belongings will not only help you figure out how much insurance you need, but it will also serve as a convenient record if you have a claim.

There are several apps available to help you take a home inventory, and [our article on how to create a home inventory](http://www.iii.org/article/how-create-home-inventory) can help, as well.

While you're reviewing your possessions, think about whether you want to insure them for actual cash value (where the policy would pay less money for older items than you paid for them new) or for replacement cost (which would cover to replace the items). The price of replacement cost coverage for homeowners is about 10 percent more but is generally a worthwhile investment in the long run. (Note that flood insurance for belongings is only available on an actual cash value basis.)

### **Create a talley of your expensive items**

There are limits on how much a standard homeowners insurance policy will cover for items such as jewelry, silverware, collectibles, and furs. For example, jewelry coverage may be limited to under $2,000. Some insurance companies may also place a limit on what they will pay for computers.

Check your policy (or ask your insurance professional) for the limits of your coverage for any expensive items. If your home inventory includes items for which the limits are too low, consider buying a special personal property floater or an endorsement. This will allow you to insure valuables individually or as a collection, with significantly higher coverage limits.

# Determine how much coverage for additional living expense insurance you may need

If you can't live in your home due to a fire, severe storm or other insured disaster, coverage for Additional Living Expenses (ALE) pays the costs of temporarily living elsewhere, including hotel bills, restaurant meals and other living expenses incurred while your home is being rebuilt.

If you rent out part of your house, this coverage also reimburses you for the rent that you would have collected from your tenant if your home had not been destroyed.

Many policies provide coverage for about 20 percent of the insurance on your house. However, ALE coverage limits vary from company to company, with some policies providing unlimited coverage for a limited amount of time. In contrast, others may only set limits on the amount of coverage.

# Determine how much liability insurance you need

The liability portion of homeowners insurance covers you against lawsuits for bodily injury or property damage that you or family members or pets cause to other people, as well as court costs incurred and damages awarded.

Most homeowners insurance policies provide a minimum of $100,000 worth of liability insurance, but higher amounts are available and, increasingly, it is recommended that homeowners consider purchasing at least $300,000 to $500,000 worth of liability coverage.

If you own property and or have investments and saving that are worth more than the liability limits in your policy, consider purchasing a separate excess liability or umbrella policy.

# Consider an umbrella or excess liability policy

Umbrella or excess liability policies provide coverage over and above your standard home (or auto) liability policy limits. These policies start to pay after you have used up the liability insurance in your underlying policy. In addition to providing additional dollar amount coverage, umbrella or excess liability often offers broader coverage than standard policies.

The cost of an umbrella policy depends on how much underlying insurance you have and the kind of risk you represent. The greater the underlying liability coverage you have, the cheaper the umbrella or excess policy. Most companies will require a minimum of $300,000 underlying liability insurance on your standard homeowners policy [for umbrella coverage](https://www.iii.org/article/what-umbrella-liability).

There's a difference between an insurance company canceling a policy and choosing not to renew it.

# Auto insurance cancellation

Insurance companies cannot cancel a policy that has been in force for more than 60 days except when:

- You fail to pay the premium
- You have committed fraud or made serious misrepresentations on your application
- Your drivers license has been revoked or suspended.

# Auto insurance non-renewal

Either you or your insurance company can decide not to renew the policy when it expires. Your insurance company must give you a certain number of days notice and explain the reason for not renewing before it drops your policy (the exact timeframes and rules will depend on the state in which you live).

There are a number of reasons an insurance company may choose not to renew a policy, and it may have nothing to do with you personally. For example, your insurer may have decided to drop that particular type of insurance or to write fewer policies where you live.

However, a nonrenewal can also be due to your record or your actions. Doing something to considerably raise the insurance company’s risk—like driving drunk—would be cause for non-renewal.

If you've been told your policy is not being renewed and you want a further explanation or think the reason is unfair, call the insurance company’s consumer affairs division. If you don't get a satisfactory explanation, contact your state insurance department.

Note that nonrenewal at one insurer doesn't necessarily mean you'll be charged a higher premium at another insurance company.

# What Determines Auto Rates

The amount you'll pay for car insurance is impacted by a number of very different factors—from the type of coverage you have to your driving record to where you park your car. While not all companies use the same parameters, here's a list of what commonly determines the bottom line on your auto policy.

- **Your driving record** – The better your record, the lower your premium. [If you've had accidents or serious traffic violations](http://www.iii.org/article/if-i-file-claim-will-my-premium-go), it's likely you'll pay more than if you have a clean driving record. You may also pay more if you're a new driver without an insurance track record.
- **How much you use your car** – The more miles you drive, the more chance for accidents so you'll pay more if you drive your car for work, or use it to commute long distances. If you drive only occasionally—what some companies call “pleasure use"—you'll pay less.
- **Location, location, location** – Due to higher rates of vandalism, theft and accidents, urban drivers pay a higher auto insurance price than those in small towns or rural areas. Where you park your car (on the street or in a secure garage) and anti-theft features may impact the bottom line as well.

Other factors that affect premium price that can vary from one area or state to another are: cost and frequency of litigation; medical care and car repair costs; prevalence of auto insurance fraud; and weather trends.

- **Your age** – In general, [mature drivers](http://www.iii.org/article/senior-drivers) have fewer accidents than less experienced drivers, particularly teenagers. Insurers generally charge more [if teenagers or young people below age 25 drive your car](http://www.iii.org/article/auto-insurance-teen-drivers).
- **Your gender** – Statistically, women tend to get into fewer accidents, have fewer driver-under-the-influence accidents (DUIs) and—most importantly—have less serious accidents than men. So all other things being equal, women often pay less for auto insurance than their male counterparts.
- **The car you drive** – The cost of your car is a major factor in the cost to insure it. Other variables include the likelihood of theft, the cost of repairs, its engine size and the overall safety record of the car. Automobiles with high quality safety equipment might qualify for premium discounts.

Insurers not only look at how safe a particular vehicle is to drive and how well it protects occupants, but also how much potential damage it can inflict on another car. If a specific vehicle model has a higher chance of inflicting damage when in an accident, an insurer may charge more for liability insurance.

- **Your credit** – Similar to your credit score, your [credit-based insurance score](http://www.iii.org/article/what-does-my-credit-rating-have-do-purchasing-insurance-1) is a statistical tool that predicts the likelihood of your filing a claim and the likely cost of that claim.
- **The type and amount of auto insurance coverage** – The limits on [your basic auto insurance](http://www.iii.org/article/what-covered-basic-auto-insurance-policy), the amount of [your deductible](http://www.iii.org/article/understanding-your-insurance-deductible), and the types and amounts of policy options (such as collision) that are prudent for you to have all affect how much you'll pay for coverage.
- **NEVER race or religion** – It is illegal to use race or religion to set insurance rates.

# Auto Insurance Basics

The basic personal auto insurance mandated by most U.S. states provides some financial protection if you or another driver using your car causes an accident that damages someone else’s car or property, injures someone or both.

But to make the best decisions about purchasing other types of auto insurance coverage you might need, you’ll want to understand what’s covered, what’s not covered and what’s optional. In addition to understanding *types* of coverage, you’ll also want to consider coverage amounts.

Why? Because state-required minimums may not cover the costs of a serious accident, so it’s worth considering purchasing higher levels of coverage.

Here’s a rundown of the *types* of coverage available—some are required; others are optional; all are priced individually (a la carte) to let you customize coverage amounts to suit your exact needs and budget.

# Mandatory coverage

Nearly every state requires car owners to carry the following auto liability coverage:

- **Bodily Injury Liability** — This covers costs associated with injuries and death that you or another driver causes while driving your car.
- **Property Damage Liability** — This coverage will reimburse others for damage that you or another driver operating your car causes to another vehicle or other property, such as a fence, building or utility pole.

# Frequently required coverage

Many states require that you carry the following coverage:

- **Medical Payments or Personal Injury Protection (PIP)** — Provides reimbursement for medical expenses for injuries to you or your passengers. It will also cover lost wages and other related expenses.
- **Uninsured Motorist Coverage** — Reimburses you when an accident is caused by an uninsured motorist—or in the case of a hit-and-run. You can also purchase ***under* insured motorist coverage**, which will cover costs when another driver lacks adequate coverage to pay the costs of a serious accident.

Even if these types of coverage are optional in your state, consider adding them to your policy for greater financial protection.

# Optional coverage

While basic, legally mandated auto insurance covers the cost of damages to other vehicles that you cause while driving, it does *not* cover damage to your own car. To cover this, you need to purchase the following optional auto insurance coverages:

- **Collision** — This optional coverage reimburses you for damage to your car that occurs as a result of a collision with another vehicle or other object—e.g., a tree or guardrail—when you’re at fault. While collision coverage will not reimburse you for mechanical failure or normal wear-and-tear on your car, it will cover damage from potholes or from rolling your car.
- **Comprehensive** — This provides coverage against theft and damage caused by an incident other than a collision, such as fire, flood, vandalism, hail, falling rocks or trees and other hazards—even getting hit by an asteroid!
- **Glass Coverage** — Windshield damage is common, and some auto policies include no-deductible glass coverage, which also includes side windows, rear windows and glass sunroofs. Or you can buy supplemental glass coverage.

# Mind the gap… insurance

If you lease or finance your vehicle, auto dealers or lenders will likely require you to purchase collision and comprehensive. But keep in mind that collision and comprehensive only cover the market value of your car, not what you paid for it—and new cars depreciate quickly. If your car is totaled or stolen, there may be a “gap” between what you owe on the vehicle and your insurance coverage. To cover this, you may want to look into purchasing **gap insurance** to pay the difference. (Note: For leased vehicles, gap coverage is usually rolled into your lease payments.)

# Who is covered—and when?

Your auto policy will cover you and other family members on your policy, whether driving your insured car or someone else’s car with permission. Your policy also provides coverage if someone not on your policy is driving your car with your consent.

Your personal auto policy only covers personal driving, whether you’re commuting to work, running errands or taking a trip. Your personal auto policy, however, will *not* provide coverage if you use your car for commercial purposes—for instance, if you deliver pizzas or operate a delivery service. Note, too, that personal auto insurance will generally not provide coverage if you use your car to provide transportation to others through a ride-sharing service such as Uber or Lyft. Some auto insurers, however, are now offering supplemental insurance products (at additional cost) that extend coverage for vehicle owners providing ride-sharing services.

Every U.S. state with the exception of New Hampshire requires its drivers to purchase liability insurance to drive legally. However, collision and comprehensive are optional, even though nearly four out of five drivers choose to purchase these coverages.

# Collision coverage

Collision pays for damage to your car resulting from a collision with an object (e.g., a telephone pole, a guard rail, a mailbox), or as a result of flipping over. The average cost is about $290 per year. Collision coverage reimburses you for the costs of repairing your car, minus the deductible.

Collision coverage also covers damage caused by potholes.

# Comprehensive coverage

Comprehensive covers damage to your car caused by disasters “other than collisions,” and costs significantly less than collision coverage. With the average cost of comprehensive totaling a little over $134 per year, the coverage is cost-effective considering it covers damages to the vehicle caused by the following:

- Contact with animals
- Natural disasters such as earthquakes, floods, hurricanes, tornadoes and volcanic eruptions
- Fire
- Riots and vandalism
- Theft of the entire car, or parts of the car such as an airbag
- Fallen objects such as trees, branches, ice or projectiles
- Broken windshield

Drivers who finance the purchase of their car may be required to purchase both collision and comprehensive coverage.

To reduce your auto insurance expenditures, I.I.I. recommends taking a higher deductible.

If you are driving an older car, do the math to see if purchasing either collision or comprehensive coverage makes economic sense.

If you lease a car, you'll still need to purchase your own [state-mandated basic auto insurance](http://www.iii.org/article/what-covered-basic-auto-insurance-policy)—and you'll very likely need additional coverages:

# Your leasing company will require collision and comprehensive auto coverage

The bank, leasing company or other entity that is financing your leased car has a monetary stake in the vehicle. They’ll want to make sure there are sufficient funds available to repair the car in the case of an accident. For that reason, you'll need to buy:

- **Collision insurance** to cover the damage to your leased car from an accident with another automobile or object.
- **Comprehensive insurance** to cover a loss to your leased auto caused by something other than a collision, such as a fire or theft.

# You'll likely be paying for gap coverage (though you may not know it)

After a new car comes off the lot, its value depreciates quickly. If your leased car is damaged beyond repair or totaled in an accident, there likely will be a difference between the amount that you still owe the auto dealer and the check you'll get from your insurance company for your depreciated car. The difference between the two amounts is known as the "gap."

On a leased car, the cost of [gap insurance](https://www.iii.org/article/what-gap-insurance) is generally rolled into the lease payments. Generally, the auto dealer buys a master policy from an insurance company to cover all the cars it leases and charges you for a "gap waiver." This means that if your leased car is totaled, you won't have to pay the dealer the gap amount. Check with the auto dealer when leasing your car for specifics that apply to your leasing contract.

# **Insuring your classic car**Unique vehicles require special auto coverage

A classic, custom, collectible or antique car requires insurance that reflects your vehicle’s uniqueness and value. If you own—or are thinking of owning—a special set of wheels, find out about the kind of policy you need.

---

# What types of vehicles need special insurance?

A classic, collectible or antique car is no ordinary car—and regular auto insurance is not sufficient to protect such a vehicle against damage or loss.

That said, there is no uniform definition of a classic car. If a car’s value exceeds its original selling price, then it might be considered collectible and a candidate for specialized classic car insurance. In general, vehicles that might warrant classic car auto insurance include:

- Antique and classic cars, usually at least 25 to 30 years old
- Hotrods and modified vehicles
- Exotic and luxury autos—think James Bond
- Muscle cars
- Classic trucks

You might also seek specialized insurance for vintage military vehicles, classic motorcycles and antique tractors.

# Qualifying for classic car coverage

A car's age is not enough to qualify for specialized classic car insurance. While requirements differ from company to company, most cars need to meet the following criteria in order to qualify:

- **Limited use** – Your classic car cannot be used for everyday commuting or errands, and your policy may include mileage limitations and proof the car is being properly garaged if you do travel with it. In some cases, insurers may require that you also own a primary car for everyday use.
- **Car shows and meetings** – The limited use provision of a classic car policy allows for travel to car shows and auto club meet-ups; however, this coverage may be restricted by some insurers. If this is the case, there are insurers that can provide specialized coverage for car shows and meetings. Before choosing a classic car insurer, it’s worth checking whether they have travel restrictions if you plan to take your car on regular, multi-day, high mileage drives.
- **Secure storage** – When not in use, your special vehicle must be stored in a locked, enclosed, private structure, such as a residential garage or storage unit.
- **A clean driving record** – You may be disqualified from classic auto insurance if you have serious offenses on your driving record, such as reckless driving, repeat speeding violations or driving while intoxicated.

Not every vehicle, however special, will meet the qualifications of every insurer. For instance, some insurers may not cover vintage off-road vehicles. Insurers may also decline to insure vehicles that are in poor condition or have been previously damaged.

# What you should know about classic car policies

Your classic car policy will include provisions found in [standard auto insurance policies](http://www.iii.org/article/what-auto-insurance), notably property damage and bodily injury liability coverage. But there are some differences, as well:

- **Your car's value** – Because each car's condition is unique, there is no set "book value" for specific makes and models. The first step in insuring your classic car is for you and your insurer to reach an agreement on the value of the vehicle. This value will be specified in your policy and your car will be covered up to that value without depreciation.

Note that, unlike everyday vehicles that depreciate over time as you add miles to them, classic cars may *gain* value. Make sure you adjust your coverage as the value of your auto appreciates.

- **Specialized repair or restoration** – Your policy should you the flexibility to bring your vintage Mercedes, Ferrari or Corvette to a specialist—even if the rates may be twice, or three times, the cost of [a typical car repair at a traditional auto body shop](http://www.iii.org/article/how-are-value-my-car-and-cost-repair-determined).
- **Special towing and spare parts** – Coverage for towing is commensurate with the special demands of transporting a classic car. Spare parts coverage, too, needs to be aligned with the cost of replacing valuable and perhaps hard-to-find vehicle components, such as wheels, transmissions, and engine parts.

# Distasters that are covered

Standard homeowners policies cover a wide range of potential disasters, from tornadoes to lightning strikes to winter storm damage. Policies do vary, though, so for your own peace of mind, check yours for the specific perils covered. Learn what's generally covered by each homeowners insurance policy type—and what's not.

# Disaster coverage by homeowners policy type

# **What type of disasters are covered?**

![Screenshot 2025-10-06 at 1.07.45 PM.png](Ohio%20P&C%20Knowledge%20Base%202845fe5c941080488b13ffa0acb91c6d/Screenshot_2025-10-06_at_1.07.45_PM.png)

# Disasters that are not covered

1. **Floods.** Flood damage is excluded under standard homeowners and renters insurance policies. Separate flood insurance coverage, however, is available for both homeowners and renters as a separate policy both from the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) and from a few private insurers. Learn more [about flood insurance](http://www.iii.org/article/facts-about-flood-insurance)—whether you need it, how to get it, and more.
2. **Earthquakes.** Earthquake coverage is available from most insurance companies as a separate policy or an endorsement to your homeowners or renters policy. Learn more [about earthquake insurance](http://www.iii.org/article/does-my-homeowners-insurance-cover-earthquake-damage).
3. **Maintenance damage.** It is your responsibility to maintain your home and take reasonable precautions to protect your home from damage. Your insurance policy will not cover damage due to lack of maintenance, [mold](http://www.iii.org/article/protecting-your-house-mold) or infestation from termites or other pests.
4. **Sewer Backup.** Sewer backups are not covered under a typical homeowners insurance policy, nor are they covered by flood insurance. This type of coverage must be purchased either as a separate product or as an endorsement to a homeowners policy, usually at a nominal cost. Learn more [about sewers and sewer backup insurance](http://www.iii.org/article/sewer-backup).

# **Making sure your home is properly covered for a disaster**How to avoid being underinsured

For many people, their home is their greatest asset, so it is crucial to avoid being underinsured. To properly insure your home, it is important to ask your insurance professional four key questions.

---

# 1. Do I have enough insurance to rebuild my home?

Your policy needs to cover the cost of rebuilding your home at current construction costs. Unfortunately, some homeowners simply purchase enough insurance protection to satisfy their mortgage lender. Others confuse the real estate value of their home with what it would cost to rebuild it.

# 2. Do I have enough insurance to replace all of my possessions?

Most homeowners insurance policies provide coverage for your personal possessions for approximately 50 percent to 70 percent of the amount of insurance you have on the structure of your home. If you have $100,000 worth of coverage on the structure of your home, you would be covered for $50,000 to $70,000 worth of the contents of your home, depending on the policy.

The best way to determine if this is enough coverage is to conduct a home inventory, which details everything you own and the estimated cost to replace these items if they are stolen or destroyed by a disaster.

# 3. Do I have enough coverage for additional living expenses?

Coverage for additional living expenses pays the extra costs of temporarily living away from your home if you can't live in it due to an insured disaster such as a hurricane. It covers hotel bills, restaurant meals, transportation and other living expenses incurred while your home is inaccessible or being rebuilt.

# 4. Do I have enough insurance to protect my assets?

Although not a key element in disaster planning, it is also important to have adequate liability protection. This covers you against lawsuits for bodily injury or property damage that you or your family members may cause to other people. It also pays for damage caused by pets.

# **Are there different types of policies?**

Yes. A person who owns his or her home would have a different policy from someone who rents. Policies also differ on the amount of insurance coverage provided.

The different types of homeowners policies are fairly standard throughout the country. However, individual states and companies may offer policies that are slightly different or go by other names such as “standard” or “deluxe”. The one exception is the state of Texas, where policies vary somewhat from policies in other states. [The Texas Insurance Department](https://www.tdi.texas.gov/) has detailed information on its various homeowners policies.

The chart below lists the disasters covered in each of the following types of policies:

# If you own your home

If you own the home you live in, you have several policies to choose from. The most popular policy is the HO-3, which provides the broadest coverage. Owners of multi-family homes generally purchase an HO-3 with an endorsement to cover the risks associated with having renters live in their homes.

HO-1: Limited coverage policy This “bare bones” policy covers you against the first 10 disasters. It's no longer available in most states.

HO-2: Basic policy A basic policy provides protection against all 16 disasters. There is a version of HO-2 designed for mobile homes.

HO-3: The most popular policy This “special” policy protects your home from all perils except those specifically excluded. (Click on the link below for a sample HO-3 form; you will need Acrobat which you can download, free of charge, from the [Adobe website](http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobat/).

Paper: Homeowners 3 - Special Form ([PDF](https://www.iii.org/sites/default/files/docs/pdf/HO3_sample.pdf))

HO-8: Older home Designed for older homes, this policy usually reimburses you for damage on an actual cash value basis which means replacement cost less depreciation. Full replacement cost policies may not be available for some older homes.

# If you rent your home

HO4-Renter Created specifically for those who rent the home they live in, this policy protects your possessions and any parts of the apartment that you own, such as new kitchen cabinets you install, against all 16 disasters.

# If you own a co-op or a condo

H0-6: condo/co-op A policy for those who own a condo or co-op, it provides coverage for your belongings and the structural parts of the building that you own. It protects you against all 16 disasters.

# Your level of coverage

Regardless of whether you are an owner or renter, you have the following three options:

1. **Actual cash value.** This type of policy pays to replace your home or possessions minus a deduction for depreciation.
2. **Replacement cost.** The policy pays the cost of rebuilding/repairing your home or replacing your possessions without a deduction for depreciation.
3. **Guaranteed or extended replacement cost.** This policy offers the highest level of protection. A guaranteed replacement cost policy pays whatever it costs to rebuild your home as it was before the fire or other disaster–even if it exceeds the policy limit. This gives you protection against sudden increases in construction costs due to a shortage of building materials after a widespread disaster or other unexpected situations. It generally won't cover the cost of upgrading the house to comply with current building codes. You can, however, get an endorsement (or an addition to) your policy called Ordinance or Law to help pay for these additional costs. A guaranteed replacement cost policy may not be available if you own an older home.

Some insurance companies offer an extended, rather than a guaranteed replacement cost policy. An extended policy pays a certain percentage over the limit to rebuild your home. Generally, it is 20 to 25 percent more than the limit of the policy. For example, if you took out a policy for $100,000, you could get up to an extra $20,000 or $25,000 of coverage.

Even though a guaranteed/extended replacement cost policy may be a bit more expensive, it offers the best financial protection against disasters for your home. These coverages, however, may not be available in all states or from all companies.

# **Understanding your insurance deductibles**Know how your deductibles work to prevent surprise costs—and save money

Deductibles have been an essential part of the insurance contract for many years. Understanding the role deductibles play when insuring a vehicle or home is integral to getting the most out of your insurance policy.

---

# Deductible defined

A deductible is the amount of money that you are responsible for paying toward an insured loss. When a disaster strikes your home or you have a car accident, the deductible is subtracted, or "deducted," from what your insurance pays toward a claim. Deductibles are how risk is shared between you, the policyholder, and your insurer.

Generally speaking, the larger the deductible, the less you pay in premiums for an insurance policy. A deductible can be either a specific dollar amount or a percentage of the total amount of insurance on a policy. The amount is established by the terms of your coverage and can be found on the declarations (or front) page of standard homeowners, condo owners, renters, and auto insurance policies.

State insurance regulations strictly dictate the way deductibles are incorporated into the policy's language and how deductibles are implemented. These laws can vary from state to state.

# How deductibles work

A specific amount would be subtracted from your claim payment if you have a dollar amount deductible. For example, if your policy states a $500 deductible, and your insurer has determined that you have an insured loss worth $10,000, you would receive a claims check for $9,500.

Percentage deductibles generally only apply to homeowners policies and are calculated based on a percentage of the home’s insured value. Therefore, if your house is insured for $100,000 and your insurance policy has a 2 percent deductible, $2,000 would be deducted from any claim payment. In the event of the $10,000 insurance loss, you would be paid $8,000. For a $25,000 loss, your claim check would be $23,000.

Note that with [auto insurance](http://www.iii.org/article/what-covered-basic-auto-insurance-policy) or a [homeowners policy](http://www.iii.org/article/what-homeowners-insurance), the deductible applies each time you file a claim. There are exceptions to this practice in Florida and Louisiana, where hurricane deductibles are applied once per season rather than for each storm.

Deductibles generally apply to property damage, not to the liability portion of homeowners or auto insurance policies. For example, with a homeowners policy, a deductible would apply to [property damaged in a rogue outdoor grill fire](http://www.iii.org/article/grilling-safely); however, there would be no deductible against the policy's liability portion if a burned guest made a medical claim or sued.

# Raising your deductible can save money

One way to save money on a homeowners or auto insurance policy is to raise the deductible. Therefore, if you're shopping for insurance, ask about the options for deductibles when comparing policies.

Increasing your auto insurance's dollar deductible from $200 to $500 can reduce optional collision and comprehensive coverage premium costs. Going to a $1,000 deductible may save you even more. Most homeowners and renters insurers offer a minimum $500 or $1,000 deductible, and raising the deductible to more than $1,000 can save on the cost of the policy.

Of course, remember that you'll be responsible for the deductible in the event of loss, so make sure that you're comfortable with the amount.

# Homeowners disaster deductibles

Standard homeowners insurance covers wind and hail damage from storms and hurricanes. Flood and earthquake policies are purchased separately. But each of these disasters has its own deductible rules. If you live in an area with a high risk for one of these natural disasters, understand how much deductible you will need to pay if a catastrophe strikes.

Start here, check your policies and speak to your insurance professional to learn exactly how your deductibles work.

- **Hurricane deductibles**. In hurricane-prone states, special deductibles may apply for homeowners insurance claims when the cause of damage is attributable to a hurricane. Whether a hurricane deductible applies to a claim depends on the specific "trigger" selected by the insurance company. These triggers vary by state and insurer and usually apply when the National Weather Service (NWS) officially names a tropical storm, declares a hurricane watch or warning, or defines a hurricane's intensity in terms of wind speed. Hurricane deductibles are generally higher than other homeowners' policy deductibles and usually take the form of a percentage of the policy limits. In some states, policyholders can choose to pay a higher premium in return for a traditional dollar deductible; however, in high-risk coastal areas, insurers may make the percentage deductible mandatory.
- **Wind/hail deductibles** work in a similar way to hurricane deductibles and are most common in places that typically experience severe windstorms and hail. These include Midwestern states (like Ohio) and around Tornado Alley (including Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, and Nebraska). Wind/hail deductibles are most commonly paid in percentages, typically from 1 percent to 5 percent.
- **Flood insurance offers a range of deductibles**. If you have—or are considering buying—flood insurance, make sure you understand your deductible. [Flood insurance](http://www.iii.org/article/does-my-homeowners-insurance-cover-flooding) deductibles vary by state and insurance company and are available in dollar amounts or percentages. Also, you can choose one deductible for your home's structure and another for the contents of your home. Note that your mortgage company may require that your flood insurance deductible under a certain amount to help ensure you will be able to pay it).
- [**Earthquake insurance](http://www.iii.org/article/does-my-homeowners-insurance-cover-earthquake-damage) has percentage deductibles** that range from 2 percent to 20 percent of the replacement value of your home, depending on location. Insurers in states with a higher than average risk of earthquakes (such as Washington, Nevada, and Utah) often set minimum deductibles at around 10 percent. In California, the basic California Earthquake Authority (CEA) policy includes a deductible that is 15 percent of the replacement cost of the main home structure and starting at 10 percent for additional coverages (such as on a garage or other outbuildings).

# **Understanding the insurance claims payment process**How are you paid? Who gets the check? Do you need to replace items immediately? Learn here.

After a disaster, you want to get back to normal as soon as possible, and your insurance company wants that too! You may get multiple checks from your insurer as you make temporary repairs, permanent repairs and replace damaged belongings. Here's what you need to know about claims payments.

---

# The initial payment isn't final

In most instances, an adjuster will inspect the damage to your home and offer you a certain sum of money for repairs, based on the terms and limits of your [homeowners](http://www.iii.org/article/what-homeowners-insurance) policy. The first check you get from your insurance company is often an advance against the total settlement amount, not the final payment.

If you're offered an on-the-spot settlement, you can accept the check right away. Later, if you find other damage, you can reopen the claim and file for an additional amount. Most policies require claims to be filed within one year from the date of disaster; check with your state insurance department for the laws that apply to your area.

# You may receive multiple checks

When both the structure of your home and your personal belongings are damaged, you generally receive two separate checks from your insurance company, one for each category of damage. If your home is uninhabitable, you'll also receive a check for the additional living expenses (ALE) you incur if you can’t live in your home while it is being repaired. If you have flood insurance and experienced flood damage, that means a separate check as well.

# Your lender or management company might have control over your payment

If you have a mortgage on your house, the check for repairs will generally be made out to both you and the mortgage lender. As a condition of granting a mortgage, lenders usually require that they are named in the homeowners policy and that they are a party to any insurance payments related to the structure. Similarly, if you live in a [coop or condominium](http://www.iii.org/article/insuring-co-op-or-condo), your management company may have required that the building's financial entity be named as a co-insured.

This is so the lender (and/or, in the case of a coop or condo, the overall building), who has a financial interest in your property, can ensure that the necessary repairs are made.

When a financial backer is a co-insured, they will have to endorse the claims payment check before you can cash it.

Depending on the circumstances, lenders may also put the money in an escrow account and pay for the repairs as the work is completed. Show the mortgage lender your contractor's bid and let the lender know how much the contractor wants upfront to start the job. Your mortgage company may want to inspect the finished job before releasing the funds for payment to the contractor.

If your home has been destroyed, the amount of the settlement and who gets it is driven by your policy type, its specific limits and the terms of your mortgage. For example, part of the insurance proceeds may be used to pay off the balance due on the mortgage. And, how the remaining proceeds are spent depend on your own decisions, such as if you want to rebuild on the same lot, in a different location or not rebuild at all. These decisions are also driven by state law.

# Your insurance company may pay your contractor directly

Some contractors may ask you to sign a "direction to pay" form that allows your insurance company to pay the firm directly. This form is a legal document, so you should read it carefully to be sure you are not also assigning your entire claim over to the contractor. When in doubt, call your insurance professional before you sign. Assigning your entire insurance claim to a third party takes you out of the process and gives control of your claim to the contractor.

When work is completed to restore your property, make certain the job has been completed to your satisfaction before you let your insurer make the final payment to the contractor.

# Your ALE check should be made out to you

Your check for additional living expenses (ALE) has nothing to do with repairs to your home. So, ensure that this check is made out to you alone and not your lender. The ALE check covers your expenses for hotels, car rental, meals out and other expenses you may incur while your home is being fixed.

# Your personal belongings will be calculated on cash value, first

You'll have to submit a list of your damaged belongings to your insurance company ([having a home inventory](http://www.iii.org/article/how-create-home-inventory) will make this a lot easier). Even if you have a replacement value policy, the first check you receive from your insurer will be based on the cash value of the items, which is the depreciated amount based on the age of the item. Why do insurance companies do this? It is to match the remaining claim payment to the exact replacement cost. If you decide not to replace an item, you’ll be paid the actual cash value (depreciated) amount for it.

# To get replacement value for your items, you must actually replace them

To get fully reimbursed for damaged items, most insurance companies will require you to purchase replacements. Your company will ask for copies of receipts as proof of purchase, then pay the difference between the cash value you initially received and the full cost of the replacement with an item of similar size and quality. You'll generally have several months from the date of the cash value payment to purchase replacements; consult with your agent regarding the timeframe.

In the case of a total loss, where the entire house and its contents are damaged beyond repair, insurers generally pay the policy limits, according to the laws in your state. That means you can receive a check for what the home and contents were insured for at the time of the disaster.

# **How to file a homeowners claim**In the event of a disaster, understand the procedures and your claim responsibilities

A violent storm damages your house. A grilling accident leaves your guest injured. A burglar breaks in. When an unfortunate event strikes close to home, you might need to file a claim with your insurance company. As part of the contract between you and your insurer, a claim against your [homeowners policy](http://www.iii.org/article/what-covered-standard-homeowners-policy) comes with rules and procedures that both your insurer and you must follow.

# Read your policy to see exactly what your responsibilities are—here are some steps to get you started.

- **Report any crime to the police.** If you are the victim of a theft or your home has been vandalized or burglarized, report it to the police. Get a police report and the names of all law enforcement officers that you speak with as you may need to provide the details of the event to your insurer.
- **Phone your insurance professional immediately.** Ask the following questions: Am I covered? How long do I have to file a claim? Will my claim exceed my [deductible](http://www.iii.org/article/understanding-your-insurance-deductible)? (If your loss is lower than your deductible, you probably won’t want to go through the claims filing process.) How long will it take to process my claim? Will I need to obtain estimates for repairs to structural damage?
- **Promptly fill out claim forms.** If you establish that you'll be making a claim your insurance company will send you the necessary claim forms—by law, these must be sent to you within a specified time period. Return the properly filled out forms as soon as possible in order to avoid delays.
- **Have the insurance adjuster inspect the damage.** Your insurance company will probably arrange for an adjuster to come and inspect your home. An adjuster is a company representative who inspects property damage to determine how much the insurance company should pay for the loss. He or she will interview you and inspect the property.
- **Prepare for the insurance adjuster’s visit.** Be prepared to show the adjuster any structural damage and have a list of damaged items ready so you can make the best use of the time.
- **Make temporary repairs.** Photograph or videotape the damage, then take reasonable steps to protect your property from further damage. If possible, avoid throwing out damaged items until the adjuster has visited your home. Save receipts for what you spend—you may be able to submit them to your insurance company for reimbursement later.
- **Prepare a list of lost or damaged articles.** You're going to need to substantiate your loss, so make a list of destroyed or damaged items, then make a copy of the list for your adjuster. Also supply him or her with available copies of receipts from damaged items. ([Having a home inventory](http://www.iii.org/article/how-create-home-inventory) will speed this part of the claims process).
- **If you need to relocate, keep your receipts.** If your home is so damaged that you need to find other accommodations while repairs are being made, keep receipts and records of all additional expenses incurred. Most homeowners insurance policies provide coverage for additional living expenses in such cases, but you’ll need to provide proof of the costs.
- **Don't be shy about asking questions.** If you have any questions about the claim filing laws in your state, call your insurance professional or your state department of insurance.

Once you and your insurance company agree on the terms of your settlement, state laws require that you be sent payment promptly.

# **How is the settlement amount determined?**

The settlement amount depends on which type of policy you have. Having inadequate insurance can affect the amount of compensation you get.

# Replacement Cost and Actual Cash Value

Replacement cost provides you with the dollar amount needed to replace a damaged item with one of similar kind and quality without deducting for depreciation—the decrease in value due to age, obsolescence, wear and tear and other factors. An actual cash value policy pays you the amount needed to replace the item minus depreciation.

Suppose, for example, a tree fell through the roof onto your eight-year-old washing machine. If you had a replacement cost policy for the contents of your home, the insurance company would pay to replace the old machine with a new one. If you had an actual cash value policy, the company would pay only a percentage of the cost of a new washing machine because a machine that has been used for eight years would be worth less than its original cost.

Suppose, also, that the tree damaged your 15-year-old roof so badly that it had to be completely replaced. If you had a replacement cost policy, the insurance company would pay the full cost of installing a new roof. If you had an actual cash value policy, it would pay a smaller percentage of the cost of replacing it.

# Extended and Guaranteed Replacement Cost

If your home is damaged beyond repair, a typical homeowners policy will pay to replace it up to the limits of the policy. When the value of your insurance policy has kept up with increases in local building costs, a similar dwelling can generally be rebuilt for an amount that is within the policy limits.

Some insurance companies offer a replacement cost policy that will pay a certain percentage over the limit to rebuild your home—20 percent or more, depending on the insurer—so that if building costs go up unexpectedly, you will have extra funds to cover the bill. These are called extended replacement cost policies. A few insurance companies still offer a guaranteed replacement cost policy that pays whatever it costs to rebuild your home as it was before the disaster. But neither a guaranteed nor an extended replacement cost policy will pay for a house that's better than the one that was destroyed.

# Mobile Home Policies

If you own a mobile home, you may have a policy based on replacement cost, actual cash value or, in a few cases, a "stated amount." With a stated amount policy, the maximum amount you receive if your home is destroyed is the amount you agreed to when the policy was issued. The depreciation in the value of your home is not considered in the settlement. If you opt for the stated amount, update your policy annually to make sure that the stated amount will cover the realistic cost of replacing your mobile home. Check with local mobile home dealers to find out what similar homes sell for now.
